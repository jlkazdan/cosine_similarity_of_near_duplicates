Although some have argued that its range may extend north into Peru, this is not well supported. is common in the international pet however, and is often in studies outside of its native range. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and 1975) degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called \"matorral\", which is found on the western of the Andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. Further north climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. Degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of habitat and by their intolerance low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced cattle and are agricultural pests in some areas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, Octodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. Degus typically weigh between 170 300 g, measure between 325 440 mm in length, including the tail. The fur yellow-brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. There is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. The tail is moderately long and conspicuously ears are large and darkly pigmented. The fifth digit is and on the forefeet it has a instead of a claw.

Pups are born furred and to see, and begin exploring within hours of birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other the genus slight in dental morphology. It is also smaller than its and its tail is to be more tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004) During annual breeding season, male-male aggression temporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burrow and monopolize the females 2 to 4) who live there. Dustbathing and urine marking may be used in the defense territory by both sexes, but these behaviors particularly increase in the male during the breeding season. Courting males engage in mutual grooming with females, and frequently perform a courtship ritual which involves wagging of the and trembling of body. The male then a hind and sprays urine onto the female. may serve to familiarize with his scent and perhaps make her more receptive his advances in the future. Receptive females may enurinate males in similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soto-Gamboa, 2005) In the wild degus to breed once per year. The breeding season usually begins in late May (autumn in Chile), and the young are conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus second has been suggested that degus may induced ovulators, but has not established for There is also some evidence that male reproductive organs may be to changes in photoperiod. The gestation is 90 days, and litter size is typically 4-6 pups. The are precocial. They are with fur and teeth; their eyes are open and they are able to move about the nest on own. Pups are weaned at 4 to 5 weeks, and become sexually mature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus reach adult size until 6 months of age, however, and they generally live in same-sex social they are about 9 months old their first breeding season occurs. It has reported that pups raised in isolation in the laboratory experience severe and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and Hurtado, 2005; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975) conception can occur, the male degu must invest considerable energy in the defense of his territory and harem from other males. The female subsequently expends energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent, and young are born well developed. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest and groups of related females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remains close to the pups until two weeks after birth, and males have been observed to huddle with young during this without instances infanticide. In the wild, male degus may spend as much time and huddling with young as females do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of venture out of the burrow at three weeks. Upon weaning at six weeks, the pups are able to live independently of the parents and form same-sex social until their firs",

They may encourage the overthrow of the and prison officials can be targeted as agents of \"illegal\" government authority. their often encourages ethnic promoting a violent and racially charged prison Since the 1980s, white supremacist organizations have spread throughout the American prison system, beginning with the growth of Aryan Brotherhood.1 Aryan Nations, although not inmates to become members, has engaged in \"prison outreach\" since 1979. In 1987, it began publishing a \"prison outreach newsletter\" called The Way to facilitate recruitment. Aryan Nations also disseminates its literature letters to The World Church of the Creator and some Identity Church groups engage in similar outreach activity, as do racist groups, such as Nation of Islam. The situation is further complicated the fact that nonideological prison gangs are often organized based on race, increases racial polarization. Imprisoned extremists also pose a security threat by continuing their activities while incarcerated. They recruit inmates, and teach other inmates extremist Some imprisoned extremists also have attempted to continue to influence outside prison by, instance, publishing newsletters from the prison to maintain their outside following. Prison officials responded in various ways, reflecting the fact that each state its own prison (as do cities, counties the federal government), and that prisons have varying populations. At times, have to limit access to extremist literature, and these responses have occasionally given rise to litigation because they potentially inmates' Amendment rights. The questions especially when the censored comes from a group that claims to be 1 Aryan Brotherhood, at one time associated with Aryan Nations, began a racist and anti-Semitic prison gang, and has developed into a crime gang associated with drug operations and violence. 2. Do inmates have the same First Amendment rights as everybody else? The United States Supreme has said that \"prison walls do not a separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" Nevertheless, inmates' First Amendment are less than other citizens' and their rights can be limited due to security or other penological concerns. Because of the particular challenges administrators face running prisons, the Supreme Court acknowledged there is a compelling government interest which warrants limiting prisoners' rights. Courts have been deferential to prison officials' assessments of threats, sensitive to their related regulatory decisions, even if such decisions impact inmates' First rights. A prison regulation that impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights will be upheld in court if that is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. This means that, generally, prison officials can ban extremist materials prisons because of concerns the distribution of such material undermine security. books, leaflets, and magazines have been forbidden to prisoners on basis. material has not been allowed through the and has not been kept the library. However, prisons have less discretion to limit inmates' religious practices than other Amendment rights due to a new federal law. Because the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), prison officials' discretion in limiting access extremist material may depend in part on whether such material is related to an inmate's religious exercise. Therefore, regulations that affect religious exercise, including access to literature, will be reviewed carefully if in court. 3. What legal standard is used to determine constitutionality of prison regulations? The Supreme Court announced standard under which it would review the constitutionality of prison regulations in v. Safley, case involving a challenge to a complete prohibition on inmate marriage. As noted earlier, a prison is constitutional if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. Under this standard, have upheld regulations based on the consideration of certain factors: - Is there valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put to justify it? - Are there alternative means of exercising the that remain open to inmates? - How great negative impact will accommodating the inmates' rights have on guards, other inmates,a nd on allocation of prison resources? Courts consider the existenc",

The Tiger would to solve two problems at once: It would sharply reduce those trash hauls and provide the military with an alternative source of fuel. It is the latest in a long line of wartime innovations, from can openers to desert boots. The conflict in Iraq has produced innovations such as \"warlocks,\" which jam electronic signals from cell phones, garage door openers and other electronic devices that insurgents use detonate roadside bombs, according to Inventors Digest. \"In wartime, you're not worried about making a profit necessarily. You're worried about getting the latest technology on the street,\" said Peter Kindsvatter, a military historian at Aberdeen Ground, who added that money is spent more freely for research when a nation is war. \"Basically, you find yourself in a technology race with your enemy.\" The Tiger, being tested in would not be the first device to turn garbage into energy - a large incinerator near Baltimore's downtown stadiums does it. But it be among the first to attempt to do it on a small scale. Its creators say it could one day become widely used in civilian life, following the lead of other wartime During World War II, contractors developed the Jeep to meet the military's desire for a light, all-purpose vehicle that transport supplies.

The high court has accepted for review far fewer free-expression-related than usual and it has stingy in recognizing First Amendment claims. In only two of the 15 decisions rendered in free-expression cases did the Court sustain those claims. How the First Amendment will fare in the future depends John Roberts differs from his predecessor, William Rehnquist, and how Miers, if confirmed, differs from During his 33 years on the Court as an associate justice chief justice, consistently free-speech and free-press claims.

The justices over the next months will hear review briefs and render opinions in several cases that have direct bearing whether we have full or constricted freedoms when we wish to play a role in the crucial political, cultural or religious issues that us. In five cases, the Court will once more take up the question of whether state laws regulating campaign contributions and pose an unconstitutional threat to political expression: Is money speech?

A careful management style knowledgeable use of technologies in medicine, toxicology property maintenance are a school administrator's best allies in preparing to deal with or prevent this new generation of health and safety challenges. sick building syndrome There is no regulatory definition sick building syndrome. Although it often relates indoor-air-quality it simply means that the environment of a building is inspiring complaints of discomfort and/or disease. Fundamentally, the causes of sick buildings relate to architecture and engineering patterns institutionalized in school construction following World War II. Schools of glass, and with high ceilings, cross-ventilation via a transom over the door, and windows and radiators could be adjusted by teachers longer were built. These schools were being replaced with new, factory-like featuring a temperamental, eccentric system of master controls for indoor environment. Buildings were constructed with no regard the environment around them or to within the property. Today, allowing for the ambiguity in defining sick buildings, somewhere between 1-in-5 and 1-in-15 school facilities are in a situation where discomfort disease can be attributed to operations of the building. Health symptoms in a building are highly variable, but generally split three categories: -Radical reaction--a number clearly and suddenly ill. This usually involves air exchange combined with a \"smoking which can include a new chemical cleaner, chlorine in a pool area, a weather inversion preventing a kiln from venting properly or a failure of a mechanical air-exchange system. -Unhealthy atmosphere--many people experiencing ongoing subtle illness or discomfort. The most common symptoms involve the dehydration of sensitive tissue, including sore eyes, throat or nasal membranes; a feeling of lethargy; a higher incidence upper-respiratory infection; asthmatic reactions; low-grade headaches; and a continuum of muscle pain and discomfort among building occupants. Much of this relates deprivation typically by being displaced by other compounds, and occasionally by infestation of microbes as a result of excessive moisture remaining within the property. -Hypersensitive reaction or multiple chemical sensitivity reaction--one or two individuals extremely ill. This result if even tiny exposures occur to anyone that has a highly sensitive reaction certain chemicals. Typically, these complaints should viewed as warnings that some low-level toxin is in the area. Although sick building syndrome usually relates to the general nature of the building itself, there are some specifics that account for most indoor-air problems: *Combustibles; any possible introduction carbon monoxide. *Moisture as it may relate mold (look for growths on drywall). *Moisture as it may relate to airborne infectious agents (standing water and consequent growths). *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), usually cleaning agents building materials, which may give off unpleasant, sometimes toxic *Formaldehydes in new carpet, pressed wood other building products. *Any new or newly exposed particleboard. *Applied poisons (pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides).

A journey that will eventually take man from his secure environment terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment called atmosphere. The vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. The brainchild behind this trek is a wealthy paper maker named Joseph There has been much speculation over just how Montgolfier the discovery of the hot air balloon. The commonly-believed story is his wife was standing too close to a and that the smoke caused her skirt to be and lifted above her knees. This caused to wonder-if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could captured in a very large container, might rise and lift a passenger along with it. So, went about building the first hot air balloon. In 1783, not much was about atmosphere and its effects on human beings. Upon examination of the occupants for ill caused by this lofty height, it was discovered that the a broken wing. Could this have been an effect of exposure to altitude? Actually, several observers noted as the balloon left the ground, the sheep had an anxiety attack and kicked the duck. Montgolfier reasoned that it would be for humans to ascend to altitude. So on November 21, 1783, Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier (a surgeon) became first and flight surgeon. Over 200 years have passed since that first flight. has allowed us to ascend the atmosphere space, but the hazards of high altitude flight (hypoxia, altitude-induced decompression sickness, and gases) will always be present. That is because humans are best suited to live in what is known as the \"physiological efficient zone\". This zone extends from sea level 12,000 feet. When humans are exposed to altitudes above this zone, they are subjected to physiological hazards beyond their to adapt. One to keep in mind is that everything that occupies space and exerts weight is to be matter. All matter made up atoms and molecules in densities. These particles within the are kinetic and in constant motion. The slower the motion of particles, the dense the matter becomes. Also, as the particles are pushed together, the matter also becomes more The best way to slow down kinetic molecules is to cool the matter. The best way to get them to move closer together is to add pressure to the matter. Inversely, when you remove the pressure or heat any material, molecules within the material moves faster and further thus making the material dense. The least dense form of matter is, of course, gas. If a gas cooled and compressed, some point it become a liquid. If that liquid is then cooled then at some point it will become solid. Also, when you take the pressure off any or liquid, that material will grow less dense and expand. This is essentially what happens to the gaseous molecules of atmosphere. Our atmosphere contains approximately 79% and 21% oxygen, a constant ratio until you reach an altitude of about 270,000 feet. So the question that comes up is; \"If I 21% oxygen sea level and 21% at 40,000 feet, do I succumb to the of hypoxia within 20 seconds that altitude?\" The is, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE! If you could picture all the gaseous nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, they would stack up from the surface of the earth to the fringe of space. All these molecules stacking on top each other create a great deal of weight, or pressure. sea level, one square-inch of any has about 15 pounds of air on top of 18,000 feet, same square inch has only 7.5 pounds per square-inch (psi) exerted it. What has caused this atmospheric pressure drop? The answer is simple: There is more air up at sea level than above 18,000 feet, and therefore, more weight. As you recall, when molecules are subjected to this pressure, they are going to move together. This will make the air more dense with oxygen and nitrogen molecules. example, at sea level you take in a breath of air that has an atmospheric pressure of 15 psi, that air may contain billion molecules of (this a fictitious number to be used only as an example); if you go to feet and take the same breath where atmospheric pressure is 7.5 psi, then you will pull in only 250 molecules of oxygen. But, you require 500 per breath function normally, and you're getting only half of what you need. That's HYPOXIA! Not only do gaseous molecules in the atmosphere expand with reduced total pressure, gases in the body are also subject to the same expansion. There are several areas in the body- ears, sinuses, gastro-intestinal tract,",

This is stories of babies dying in large numbers haunt newspaper headlines. India is behind and Sri Lanka in life expectancy at birth or under-five mortality level. India accounts for about 17 per cent of the world population, but contribute to a fifth of the world's share of diseases. A third of all diarrhoeal diseases in the world occurs in India. The country has the second largest number of HIV/AIDS cases after South Africa. It home to one-fifth of population afflicted with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. A common that I hear is that we have limited resources to tackle the and burgeoning health problems. But even the country on earth, the United States of America, has to provide appropriate services to a large section of populace. The problem in India is quite different. Apart from poor nation with limited resources, it also has a sizeable population in of basic health Furthermore, the lack of appropriate sanitary measures and education ensures ever increasing presence of communicable disease that have been controlled and even eradicated in the developed nations. India's list woes does stop here. Lack of foresight on the part of successive governments and selective and fragmented strategies to daily problems without a public health goal have the mainstay of health policies. Resource allocation to this sector is influenced by the prevailing fiscal situation as well as by the priorities of the government. Unfortunately, in Bengal — state that faces a dismal fiscal situation — the government's priorities have been skewed as a result of political necessities. Although we have a new government at helm, it is important to realize that gross changes at the level cannot be initiated without having a team with and knowledge define a well-thought-out strategy. It also essential to a government that is to fulfil the financial needs necessary for the strategy to work. It is difficult, if not impossible, to paint a picture of the present state of public health in Bengal to suggest measures to rectify the same in a short article like this. My intention is to highlight core plaguing the system and to suggest solutions based on accepted principles of public health and healthcare The steps that need to be taken are as follows: reducing disease burden, including infectious diseases as well as non-communicable epidemics like diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease; restructuring the existing primary system to make it more accountable; creating a skilled and professional workforce which is quality driven; financial planning to bring more to the health sector. Reducing disease burden is the cornerstone of any good health policy. The factors that help reduce communicable diseases are clean drinking improved sanitation and an effective vaccination programme. A shift, from the prevalent curative approach to a preventive approach, health promotion by inculcating behavioural to reduce disease burden. West Bengal is one of four states that urgently needs high in water toilet facilities. It estimated that Rs 18,000 crore is required to provide effective drinking water and sanitation facilities the entire country. Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha would account for more than 60 per cent of total outlay. a huge investment is required to provide nutritional supplements to malnourished and pregnant lactating mothers living below the poverty line. According to a report by the national commission on macroeconomics and health, West Bengal would need to harness an additional resource requirement of (in crore) 1,286, 4,693, and 8,485 in sectors such as health, and sanitation, nutrition, primary schooling roads. It has been projected that in the next five years West Bengal will spend a portion of its revenues on wages and salaries, interest payments and pensions, leaving very little for discretionary expenditure in the health. It is imperative that the present government rethink and strategize in collaboration with the Centre to ensure appropriate funding necessary to make the state healthy. Restructuring the present healthcare delivery system is also equally important. Most healthcare centres are old, dilapidated buildings",

Gouverneur Morris wanted to voting with property, considering them educated able to choose wise leaders. “The ignorant and dependant,” Morris “can be… little trusted with the public interest.” Colonel Mason countered arguments of this kind, saying all citizens should have voting rights and privileges. Doctor Franklin sided with Colonel Mason believing that restricting the right to vote to land owners would cause contention among the In the end Morris’s proposal to restrict the franchise to property owners was defeated soundly (7-1-1).

Although signature-based detection can be argued to have overshadowed by more sophisticated methods of protection in some environments, it remains as a core ‘technique’ featuring in the anti-virus controls of packages and suites that work to a user’s system today. How does signature-based detection work? Signature-based detection works by scanning the contents of computer files and cross-referencing their contents with the “code signatures” to viruses.

If a viral signature is detected, the acts to protect the user’s system from damage. files are typically quarantined and/or encrypted in order to render them inoperable and useless. Clearly there will always be new and emerging viruses with their own unique code signatures.

Next-generation signature-based detection New variants computer are of course developed every day and companies now work users from malware that attempts to disguise itself from traditional signature-based detection.

NOAA is now upgrading this even more data traffic, with the goal of ultimately supporting 100-Gbps data rates. “Our scientists were really used to having a computer in their basement,” says Jerry Janssen, manager, n-wave Network, NOAA, in a video about project. “When that moved couple thousand miles away, we had them a lot of assurances that, one, the data would actually move at the speed they needed it move, but also that they could rely on it to be there. The amount of data that will be generated under this model will exceed 80-100 Terabits per day.” The n-wave project means much more than just a massive new data It a fundamental shift in the way that scientists conduct their research, allowing them to perform hugely supercomputer runs of their data from dozens of remote locations. As a result, gives NOAA climate scientists flexibility where and how they work. “For the first time, NOAA scientists and engineers in completely separate parts of the country, all the way to places like Alaska and Hawaii and Puerto Rico, will have the bandwidth they need, without restriction,” says Janssen. “NOAA will now be able to do things it never thought it could do In to providing fast, stable access to HPC resources, n-wave is also allowing NOAA climate scientists to resources much more easily with scientists in the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. Ideally, of collaboration and access to supercomputing resources will help climate scientists continue to develop more effective climate models, improve weather forecasts, and allow us to better understand our climate. Powering Vital Climate Research The high-speed HPC connectivity capability provided by n-wave is now enabling a broad range of NOAA basic science and research activities. Examples include: - Basic data allowing research teams to collect up-to-the-minute on ocean, atmosphere, and weather from across the country, and make that data available to other research teams and agencies nationwide. - Ensemble forecasting, where researchers run multiple HPC simulations using different initial conditions and modeling techniques, in order to refine their atmospheric forecasts and minimize errors. - Severe weather modeling, where scientists draw on HPC atmospheric data, and archived storm data better understand and predict the behavior of storms. Advancing understanding of the environment to be able to better predict short-term long-term environmental changes, mitigate and provide the most accurate data to inform policy decisions. All of this work is important, and will help advance our of Earth’s climate. And it is all a testament to the networking technologies and infrastructure that scientists now have at their disposal, which puts the most powerful supercomputing resources in the at their fingertips – even when they are thousands of miles away.",

What’s the news: If bacteria the predatory Micavibrio aeruginosavorus would essentially be it by hunting down other bugs, attaching to them, and sucking their life out. For first time, researchers have sequenced the genome of this strange which was identified decades ago sewage water. The sequence will help better understand the unique bacterium, which has potential to be used as a “living antibiotic” due to its attack drug-resistant biofilms and its apparent for dining on Anatomy of a Vampire: - The bacterium has an interesting multi-stage life history. During migratory phase it sprouts a single flagellum and goes hunting for prey. Once it find a delectable morsel of bacterium, it attacks and irreversibly attaches to the surface, and sucks out all of the good stuff: carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, DNA, etc. - Sated, the divides in two via binary fission, and the host is left for dead. Hungry for Pathogens: - M. aeruginosavorus cannot be grown by itself; it must be cultured along with another bacteria to feed upon. A 2006 study found that it only grew upon three bacterial species, all of can cause pneumonia-like disease in humans. A recent study showed that it can prey upon a wider variety of microbes, most of them pathogenic, like E. coli. - These studies also found that M. aeruginosavorus has a knack biofilms, the dense collection of bacteria that cause harmful plaques on teeth and medical implants alike, and can be up to 1,000 resistant to antibiotics than free-swimming bugs. - The bacteria can also swim through viscous fluids like mucous Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacterium that can colonize lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and form a glue-like film. - qualities have caught the eye of researchers who think it could be used as a living antibiotic to treat biofilms and various types drug-resistant bacteria, which are a growing problem in medicine. Sequencing the organism’s genome is an important step in understanding its biochemistry and how it preys on other microbes. Clues From the Vampire Code: The new found each phase of involves the use (or expression) of different sets of genes. The migratory/hunting phase involves many segments that code for flagellum formation and genes involved in quorum sensing. The attachment phase involves a wide variety secreted chemicals enzymes that facilitate the flow of materials from the host. - Micavibrio aeruginosavorus no genes for amino acid transporters, a rather rare only seen in few other bacterial species that depend heavily their host to help them shuttle these protein This absence helps explain the bacterium’s dependence on narrow range of prey, from which it directly steals amino acids. Although it remains unclear how the microbe attaches to and infiltrates cells. The Future Holds: - The range of microbes upon which Micavibrio aeruginosavorus can survive is expanding; after being kept in laboratory conditions it has apparently evolved a more diverse diet. If this expansion continues, that could be a real problem for its use as an antibiotic; it could begin to eat beneficial gut example. - Researchers claim it is harmless to gut microbes, been tested on all the varieties of bacteria present in humans. - Several important steps must be taken before testing in people, like learning what traits makes another tasty to Micavibrio aeruginosavorus. Researchers speculate bacterium need be genetically altered order to go after specific or to reduce the risk of it unforeseen complications. Reference: Zhang E Kadouri, Martin Wu.

I walked in a class that had been turned into underwater was awash with a tide of enthusiastic and industrious learnning. - Streamers of various shades of blue were hung two lines that the class.From these lines also hung starfish, sharks and other that the children had made. - The Wii was hooked to the whiteboard and the gameplay was integral to the learning. - The children were divided into ‘dive teams’ and their ‘dive leader’ to manage certain aspects of how the children worked together. - Children were engaged with a teacher led leson that investigated buoyancy. were searching the web to find out more about some of the creatures that in the game. - A spreadsheet activity detailing the range of creatures that they had discovered was in place. - A shipwreck by the sitting in the This helped drive much of the creative writing - The children created treasure maps and were using these to look at grid references. - Mermaids were created in art and design and very lifelike they too! Reference books were in great demand when I was in the class and the initial of the game appeared to drive a real interest for what could be found in the complementary resource that was the book. - Children actively to measure exactly how 7 metres as result finding out that that was how long a Great White Shark was. This was just a wonderful visit and an example of what learning in class can be. Yes we need creative teachers to lead this but isn’t that what are meant to be. The work that was in evidence this class was delightful to witness and further cemented my ideas of the possibilities of sandbox games such Endless Ocean. Categories Stirling Council",

Devadatta is have caused a in sangha by persuading to leave the Buddha and follow him instead. This story of Devadatta is preserved the Tipitika. In this story, Devadatta entered the order of Buddhist monks at the as Ananda and other noble youths of Shakya clan, the clan of the historical Buddha. Devadatta himself to practice. But he became frustrated when he failed to progress toward becoming an arhat. So, he applied his practice toward developing supernatural power instead of the realization of enlightenment. It was said also became jealousy of his kinsman, the Buddha. Devadatta believed he should be the World-Honored One and the leader of the order of One day he approached the Buddha and pointed out that the Buddha was growing older. He proposed that he be put in charge the to relieve the Buddha of burden. The Buddha Devadatta harshly and said he was worthy. Thus Devadatta became the Buddha's enemy. Later, Buddha was questioned how his harsh response to Devadatta was justified Right Speech. I'll come back to this a later. Devadatta had gained the favor of Prince of Magadha. Ajatasattu's father, King Bimbisara, was a devoted patron of the Buddha. Devadatta persuaded the prince to murder his father and assume the throne of Magadha. At the same time, Devadatta vowed to have the Buddha murdered so he could take over the sangha. So that the deed could not be back to Devadatta, the plan was to a group of \"hit men\" to assassinate the first one, then a third group to take out the second one, so on for time. But when would-be approached the Buddha they couldn't carry the order. Then Devadatta tried do the job by dropping a rock on the Buddha. The rock bounced the side and broke into pieces. The next attempt involved a large bull elephant in a drug-induced fury, but the elephant was gentled in the presence. Finally Devadatta attempted to split the sangha by claiming superior moral rectitude. He proposed list austerities and that become mandatory for all monks and nuns. were: - Monks must live all their lives in forest. - Monks live only on alms obtained begging, and should not accept invitations to with others. - Monks must robes made only from rags from rubbish heaps and cremation grounds. must not accept of cloth at any time. (See - Monks must sleep at the foot of trees and not under a roof. - Monks refrain from eating fish or meat throughout their The Buddha responded as Devadatta had predicted he would. He that monks could follow the first four austerities if they wished, but he refused make them mandatory. And he rejected the fifth austerity entirely. (See Buddhism persuaded 500 monks that his Super Austerity Plan was a path to enlightenment than the Buddha's, and followed Devadatta to become his disciples. In response, the Buddha sent two of his disciples, Sariputra and Mahamaudgayalyana, to teach the dharma to the wayward monks. Upon hearing the explained correctly, the 500 monks returned the Buddha. Devadatta was now a and broken man, and he soon fell mortally ill. On deathbed he repented of his and to Buddha one more time, but Devadatta died before his liter-bearers could reach him. Life of Devadatta, Alternate Version The of the Buddha and his disciples were preserved in several oral recitation before they were written down.

In brief, the Buddha was about the harsh words he to Devadatta that caused him turn against Buddha. The Buddha justified his criticisms of Devadatta by comparing him to a small child who had taken a pebble his and was about to swallow it. Adults would do whatever it took get the pebble out of the child. Even if extracting the pebble drew blood, it must be done. The moral appears to that it is better hurt",

Many of us at home, though, have no idea what wind shear is, or if we do, how it affects tornado production. What is Wind Shear shear, although it might sound complex, a simple concept. Wind shear is merely the change in with height, in terms of wind direction and speed. I think that we all understand the wind is generally stronger in the atmosphere over our heads than it is here on the ground, and we think of atmosphere in terms of the three dimensions that has, should be surprising that the wind above us might be blowing from a different direction the wind at the ground. that happens–the wind speed and direction vary with height–wind shear is occurring. Wind Shear and Supercell Thunderstorms This wind shear is an important of the process in the development of a supercell thunderstorm, from which the vast majority of strong tornadoes form. thunderstorms are produced by a powerful updraft–a surge of air that rises from the ground into the upper levels of the atmosphere, and when this updraft forms in an area where wind shear is present, the updraft is influence by and different direction of the wind above, pushing the column of in the updraft a more vertical alignment. Rain’s on Tornado Production Needless to say, thunderstorms produce very heavy rain, and rain-cooled air is much heavier than the warm air of the updraft, the rain-cooled air, produces a compensating downdraft (what comes up, must come down). This downdraft pushes part of the rotating air that was forced in its direction by wind aloft downward, and the result is a horizontal column of air. That’s Not a Tornado! I know what you’re thinking that you’ve seen enough or Channel shows to know that a horizontal column air is NOT a need a vertical column of air. This Can Be Tornado You’re right, but the updraft that is driving the thunderstorm is still working, it’s able to pull the horizontal, column of air into the thunderstorm, resulting in a vertical column of spinning air.

Drylands are a major global biome, home to a great diversity of species and some of our treasured natural heritage. They are also home to over 2 billion people and in the developing world in particular they are associated poverty and social inequity. Global development and environment goals are not met in the drylands: by 2015 many dryland regions are set to to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, whilst progress towards the goals and objectives of the environmental conventions Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biological Diversity particular) is generally poor. Recent experiences the drylands of emerging countries, such as China and India, illustrate that economic development in drylands can in areas that are usually considered “high potential”. Although is often with degradation, experiences Sub Saharan Africa illustrate that economic development can be greatly enhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. By taking an even global view of drylands and examining industrialised dryland countries, it clear that every seemingly-insurmountable challenge we are able find evidence a viable somewhere in the world. To address the challenges of the drylands, we need understand their unique features and how these have to managed. Perhaps the most important of these is climate unpredictability: the of precipitation varies between areas, seasons between years. The sheer magnitude of this uncertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought-years aside, can plus or minus 50% of the average. Yet in many water-deficit continues agricultural practices that expose farmers to huge whilst simultaneously degrading the natural resource base on they depend. Climate change is a cause for concern in dryland areas, but also an opportunity for new approaches and new that illustrate the dryland areas. Dryland ecosystems and people are highly adaptable and can survive their uncertain climate.. Whether drylands become wetter or drier as a result of climate change, they will almost invariably become more unpredictable and adaptive capacity will be vital to their future. Drylands more than any other ecosystem have the capacity to deal with that unpredictability and we have a great deal to learn from them. Contrary to popular perception, drylands are not necessarily poverty traps. Dryland ecosystems and their goods and services already contribute significantly to national and international economies. The vibrant tourism in Eastern and Africa relies heavily on the biodiversity of drylands. dryland commodities include meat and milk and dryland goods like Gum Arabic, Henna, Aloe, and Recent years have seen the development of natural medicines from drylands, and untold numbers of medicinal plants remain un-researched, only to the dryland inhabitants who have and conserved them Local knowledge the drylands is rich and is a powerful to be harnessed. There has been a to dismiss this knowledge, because local dryland practices have portrayed as backward or inappropriate and in need of replacing. The current emergency in the Horn of Africa graphically illustrates outcome of this attitude: populations are exposed to insupportable risk a result of losing their traditional strategies and being pushed into ways of life that simply don’t work. Where people are driven towards catastrophe it almost guaranteed that the environment will similar consequences. Customs and cultures that intimately connected to biodiversity become contorted a system of where respect the environment becomes an unaffordable luxury. The scientific explanation the rationale traditional strategies has been known for long enough to develop innovative new approaches to drylands management. Development support to enable management of the extreme climatic uncertainty of drylands and needs to be built on understanding of the drivers of continuous change ecosystems. These dynamic ecosystems in which adaptation and flexibility are pre-requisites for survival. need to learn from past failures and successes and ensure that development and humanitarian interventions recognize dryland characteristics and build on local knowledge and to turn the existing opportunities into equitable sustainable wealth creation. In particular we need generate greater awareness of the tremendous opportunities for strengthening",

Only in those cases which the macula is affected will patients report blurred vision, metamorphopsia, micropsia, or scotomas. Other associated clinical findings may include induced hyperopia and delayed retinal recovery time the photostress test. Most individuals with RPE detachment are male, between the of 20 and 60 The history often reveals concurrent ocular conditions such as macular central serous chorioretinopathy (ICSC), presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), or choroidal degeneration. In other cases, the condition occurs RPE appears ophthalmoscopically as single or well-circumscribed round or oval lesions within the posterior fundus. The lesions are typically dome-shaped slight elevation and appear yellow orange in A reddish \"halo\" is often seen around the base of the detachment, and overlying pigment defects such as clumping or are commonplace. Lesions may vary in size from one-fifth to over 5 disc diameters (DD), but most are less than 1 DD. Fluorescein and indocyanine (ICG) angiography show early hyperfluorescence of the entire RPE detachment, which persists throughout the angiogram demonstrating late pooling. Leakage into the sensory retina occurs only in cases of serous detachment. RPE detachment is a non-specific anatomical alteration that may result from any number of choroidal disorders that disrupt the normal junction between the basement membrane of the RPE and inner collagenous layer of Bruchs membrane. disruption permits serous fluid from the underlying to gain into the sub-RPE space. Age-related degeneration, choroidal neovascular membranes, high myopia, angioid streaks, hereditary choroidal degeneration, POHS, and tumors of the choroid have all been identified as precipitating conditions in the development of RPE detachment. Idiopathic cases sometimes with ICSC; some believe two to represent a continuum of a similar underlying pathology. Uncomplicated idiopathic serous detachments of the RPE often spontaneously, however, those associated with more generalized to choriocapillaris may be complicated by hemorrhage, choroidal membrane formation, and disciform scarring. Most patients the age of 55 who present with serous RPE without evidence other retinal or choroidal disease enjoy an without intervention. This is particularly if the lesion is outside of the fovea and there is no associated subretinal fluid. patients who manifest RPE detachment without angiographic evidence of a choroidal membrane have a 25-30 percent chance of developing such membranes during their lifetime, therefore warrant careful as well as weekly home monitoring with an Amsler grid. Those patients over the age of 55 who present with associated choroidal neovascular and/or hemorrhagic RPE detachments have an exceedingly poor visual prognosis. Focal photocoagulation is indicated for these patients. Approximately 90 percent of cases of RPE detachment have or will manifest concurrent serous retinal detachment over the natural history of the disorder. In cases of idiopathic RPE detachment, a striking similarity with ICSC seen in the patient population; i.e. male, average age of 44 years, and a moderate to severe emotional stress level. The of RPE detachment is quite characteristic. Nonetheless, one must sure to rule out other that may appear similar from an ophthalmoscopic perspective. These include: ICSC, malignant carcinoma, choroidal hemangioma, and Bests (vitelliform History and angiography are the most helpful factors in making this detachment in patients over 55 years of age be considered to choroidal neovascular membrane, rather idiopathic, until proven otherwise.

Bear femur fragment from Slovenia, 43+kya DOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL BONE 'FLUTE' (AND REPLY BY MUSICOLOGIST BOB FINK) Science News 153 (April 1998): 215. By B. Bower Amid media fanfare, a team in 1996 trumpeted an ancient, hollowed out bear bone pierced on one side with four complete or partial holes as the earliest known musical instrument. The perforated found in an Eastern European cave, represents a flute made and played by Neandertals at least 43,000 ye us ago, the scientists contended. Now it's to stop the music, say two archaeologists who examined the purported flute last spring. On closer inspection, the bone appears to been punctured and by the of animal -- perhaps a wolf -- as it stripped the limb of meat and marrow April Nowell and Philip Chase, both of the of Pennsylvania in \"The bone was heavily chewed one or more carnivores, holes that became more rounded due to natural processes after burial,\" Nowell says. \"It provides very weak evidence for the origins of [Stone Age] Nowell presented the new analysis the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society Seattle last week. Nowell and Chase examined the bone the permission of its discoverer, Ivan Turk of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana (S.N.: 11/23/96, p. 328). Turk knows of their conclusion still views the specimen as a flute. Both open ends of thighbone contain clear signs of gnawing by carnivores, Nowell asserts. and other animals typically off nutrient-rich tissue at the ends of limb bones and available marrow. If Neandertals had hollowed out the bone and fashioned holes in it, animals have bothered to gnaw it, she says. Complete and partial holes on the bone's shaft were also made by carnivores, says Nowell. Carnivores typically break open bones with their scissor like cheek teeth. Uneven bone thickness and signs of wear along borders of holes, products of extended in the indicate that openings by cheek teeth were at first less rounded and slightly smaller, the researchers Moreover, the simultaneous pressure of an upper and lower tooth produced a set of holes, one and one complete, they maintain. Prehistoric, carnivore-chewed bear bones in two Spanish caves display circular punctures aligned in much the same way those on the Slovenian find. In March Antiquity, Francesco d'Errico of Institute of Quaternary Prehistory and in Talence, France, his colleagues describe the Spanish bones. In a different twist, Bob Fink, an independent musicologist in Canada, has reported on the Internet (http://www.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm) the spacing of the two complete and two partial holes on the back of the Slovenian bone conforms to musical notes on the diatonic (do, re, mi. . .) scale. The bone is too short to incorporate the diatonic scale's seven notes, counter Nowell and Chase. Working with Pennsylvania Robert Judd, they that the find's 5.7-inch is less than half that cover the diatonic spectrum. The recent meeting presentation is \"a most convincing analysis,\" comments Desmond Clark of the University of California, it's possible that Neandertals blew single notes through carnivore-chewed holes in the bone. \"We exclude that possibility,\" Nowell responds. it's a big leap of faith conclude that this was an intentionally flute.\" TO THE EDITOR, SCIENCE (REPLY BY BOB FINK, May 1998) (See an update of this discussion on Bob Fink's web site, November 2000) The doubts raised by Nowell and Chase 4th, DOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDERTHAL 'FLUTE') saying the Neanderthal Bone is not a flute have these weaknesses: The alignment of the holes all in a row, and of equivalent appear to be to most teeth marks, unless some holes were made independently by several animals. latter case boggles the odds the holes ending being in line. It also would be strange that animals homed in on this one bone in cave full bones, where no of similarly bones have been made. claim harder to when it is calculated that chances for holes to be arranged, by chance, in a pattern that matches the spacings of 4 notes of a diatonic are only one in hundreds to occur .

Due to the fussy nature of seed germination, plants are more commonly grown by division of narrow rhizomes.If happy, wood will multiply rapidly via rhizomes to produce a large-size colony.If dug after flowering, you can separate the plants numerous plantlets. All need is a growing stem and a couple of inches the rhizome. In garden, wood anemones prefer dappled shade.Their soil should moderately moist and organic-rich.They make admirable groundcovers under deciduous trees in climates, may go dormant by mid summer.In cool climates, they will stay green well into September.

Xantusia magdalena occurs in Baja California. Xantusiidae a relatively small clade, genera approximately 30 species. Lepidophyma the most speciose species), whereas Cricosaura is monotypic. Xantusiids have a reasonably good fossil extending from the mid-Paleocene onward in western North America. Xantusiids are fascinating lizards for several reasons. First, although they are almost uniformly diminuitive (Xantusia magdalena measures less than 4 cm snout-vent length, and the xantusiid species measure about 10 cm snout-vent xantusiids generally take several years to reach sexual maturity, and several species give birth to just 1 or 2 offspring. It is a more usual reproductive strategy for small lizards mature quickly and produce large numbers of offspring, to increase their chances of survival. Despite this low reproductive potential, xantusiid neonates a life expectancy; this be attributed least in part to their lifestyle, which leads to the second reason why xantusiids are particularly interesting -- microhabitat Microhabitat specialization is an ecological hallmark of Xantusiidae. Many populations are narrowly restricted to specific niches -- crevices (e.g., Xantusia henshawi in granitic cap rocks), interstices in agaves and yuccas in climates (e.g., X. magdalena), decaying logs in wet climates Lepidophyma flavimaculatum) -- and individuals may be found under the same patch of cover throughout their lives! These microhabitat restrictions result in extremely disjunct geographical distributions, and also may be responsible for some morphological convergence within group (e.g., flattened skulls for crevice Xantusiidae also includes two insular endemics: the Cuban Cricosaura typica is the only xantusiid found in the West Indies and is interpreted as one of the Caribbean's few ancient endemic vertebrate lineages; and riversiana (formerly Klauberina is limited to three of the Channel Islands off the coast of California. The phylogenetic relationships of Xantusiidae are problematic. Morphology and molecules produce different topologies within the clade: morphology recovers a + Lepidophyma clade, while mitochondrial genes recover a Lepidophyma Xantusia clade. of resolution of relationships within Xantusiidae has hindered the placement of this clade within the squamate tree. Xantusiidae is a \"tree-changing\" taxon: it causes homoplasy it is and its placement can tip the balance between the primary competing hypotheses of scleroglossan relationships. Xantusiidae is traditionally placed within Scincomorpha, but some have placed it Gekkota. Thus, Xantusiidae is either a highly derived, or extremely basal, scleroglossan clade. Previous analyses of squamate phylogeny have almost certainly suffered in relying on species of the readily available -- but relatively derived -- genus Xantusia exemplars for Xantusiidae. Cricosaura or a species of Lepidophyma would be more appropriate, but both are exceedingly rare in collections; indeed, species of Lepidophyma are known from only 1 2 specimens. Whatever the placement of Xantusiidae within squamates, there is no doubt that xantusiids monophyletic. The following are some of the hypothesized synapomorphies of the lineage (from Estes et al., 1988), most of which can be seen in skull reconstructions above: supratemporal fenestra closed by postorbital; paired well into postembryonic ontogeny; parietal table extensive posteriorly, largely obscuring dorsal view, supratemporal short; vomers fused; ectopterygoid contacts palatine anterolaterally, excluding from suborbital fenestra; ectopterygoid enlarged medially, restricting suborbital fenestra.

Selfless and steadfast, Ms. Maathai has been a champion environment, of women, of Africa, and of concerned about our security.” “Some say that AIDS came from the monkeys, and I doubt that, because we have been living with monkeys [since] time others say it was a curse from God, but I say it cannot be that.... Us black people are dying more than any other people in this planet. It’s true that there are some who create agents to wipe out other people.” “Why is the rest of the world just watching,” Maathai asks, nothing while Africans are being wiped The rest of the world has abandoned us.” There is, of course, a very real genocide throughout sub-Saharan Africa, as Muslim murder indigenous black Christians and animists, 100,000 in Darfur alone. The rape of young black boys by Arabs is now commonplace. These scenes first played out during the genocide in Rwanda, which began early in the Clinton administration, and have been all over the sub-continent for a decade. Maathai addressed this brutality at the World Women’s in Beijing in 1995, blamed it on Western capitalists. She claims that Western governments laid the groundwork for present slaughter during the Cold War. “The carnage goes on in Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia and in the streets many cities,” says. “People continue to be sacrificed so that factories may open, earn capital and save jobs.” Thus in Maathai’s view, Arab is the fault of wealthy whites. Maathai has courted global socialism through her long association with the United Nations’ environmentalist agenda. She was a member the Commission on Global Governance (CGG), founded in 1992 at the suggestion of former West German Chancellor and socialist Maathai worked on the CGG alongside Maurice Strong, Jimmy Carter, and McNamara.

She was a genius at molding behaviors with lures and gently “modeling” a dog into without force. But even used some techniques that can be considered rough by today’s standards. If you have researched dog-training methodologies at all, have noticed that a percentage of the available training books advocate the use of a “choke chain” (otherwise called the training collar). When used properly, this training device relies on aversion to get the dog’s attention or to make a correction when your dog doesn’t respond to a command correctly. A sharp snap of the leash tightens the collar around the dog’s neck, the dog with a momentary, low-level pain. chain is not a training device for leash pullers, as is commonly thought, and when used incorrectly can, at the least, of the spine and trachea damage. At worst, it can cause brain and even death. Because there is such a high risk for misuse of this device (you may not that the choke chain should be with free ring up, for instance), the training world probably would be better off without it. Your efforts to train your should focus on building a bond and nurturing trust. This bond becomes the motivator that drives your dog to learn, focus and respond. Why would want to force or violence when positive reinforcement works so well? Why should your dog trust you if he knows you are likely to hit him when he is unfocused or confused? That’s like your supervisor yelling at you when you problems with a difficult task. Stress won’t help you concentrate or focus better. Abusive of dogs the name training, just as abusive handling of employees the name of supervision, doesn’t work. It however, tell us a lot about the trainer.

The president explained why he had waited so long after the had ended to act: It had always been America’s hope, Truman wrote, to create a treaty of peace the government of a united free Germany, but the policies by the Soviet Union “made it impossible.” After the war, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union divided Germany into zones of occupation. Berlin, while located wholly the Soviet zone, jointly occupied by the wartime allies also subdivided into four sectors because of its importance nation’s historic capital and seat of the former Nazi government. three western zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany May 1949, and the Soviets followed suit in October 1949 with the establishment of the Democratic Republic. The East regime began to in May 1989, when the removal of Hungary’s fences punched a hole in the Iron Curtain, allowing tens of thousands of East Germans to to the West.

All of us will need better skills in listening, communicating, and facilitating groups, these are the talents that build strong relationships. (Wheatley, 1992, p. 38) In face of today's challenging social and issues, many new efforts are underway help children and families. One solution that many communities have adopted is the establishment collaborative partnership that involves all the relevant partners—home, and community—in the planning and monitoring of for children. Unfortunately, achieving a strong partnership with meaningful participation can often be difficult and time-consuming. This article focuses on set of training materials that has been developed to assist partnerships in their efforts. materials highlight eight elements of continuity and successful partnerships: (1) families as partners, (2) shared leadership, comprehensive/responsive services, (4) culture and language, (5) communication, (6) knowledge and skill development, (7) appropriate care and education, and (8) evaluation of success. Results from a field study included more than 200 reviewers and 8 pilot sites are summarized. Results indicate that a majority of reviewers found the training materials easy to understand, relevant to their work, and up-to-date. In addition, data gathered from the pilot sites indicate that partnerships found the materials practical and useful for addressing a variety of issues, including time constraints, communication gaps, differences in professional training, and funding face a host of problems that threaten the health and well-being of children and families. Poverty, unemployment, inadequate care/education, and poor health care are just a few of difficult issues communities must confront. What these issues particularly challenging is that children and families who experience one problem are often likely to experience other problems as well. Compounding problem is that delivery of services to children and families is fragmented and scattered. Even efforts designed to the quality and supply of services to children and families have, at times, created greater fragmentation and discontinuity. In previous years, those who to improve outcomes for concentrated only on the child. however, many service providers have come to understand that the best way to serve and preserve children is to serve and preserve the supportive networks that benefit children (Family Support America, 1996). An extensive body of research identifies the elements that contribute to children's well-being, beginning with those closest to the child and moving outward encompass the family, early care/education, the neighborhood, the community, and beyond. ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) has motivated a growing number of communities to focus more closely on the need for collaboration--engaging in a process allows the community to many problems at once rather than one at a time. One solution that many communities have adopted is the establishment of a collaborative partnership involving all the relevant partners--home, and service the planning and monitoring of services for children (Kagan, 1992; Hoffman, 1991). The goal of most of these collaboration initiatives to improve child recognizing that many of the child's needs are closely linked to needs of the family and the community. to Collaboration Community collaboratives/partnerships one of the most challenging--yet one of the most effective--efforts for creating a flexible, comprehensive system that meets the of children and families. They involve new relationships among service providers and the and families they serve. They require time, resources, and the willingness of collaborating agencies to learn about and establish trust each other. In they require change (Bruner, & Knuth, 1992). As a result of the new roles and responsibilities that service providers must assume, collaboratives/partnerships encounter many common difficulties, (Melaville, Blank, & Asayesh, 1996): staff or agency representatives who are resistant to power; - policies and regulations within agencies that make it difficult coordinate services, information, and resources; - differences in prior knowledge, or experience that make it difficult for members communicate and work together; and - lack of time to meet plan together.

Kinabalu is the highest peak in Borneo's Crocker Range and is the mountain in the Malay Archipelago. Mount Kinabalu is also the 20th most prominent mountain the world by topographic prominence. In 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology established its summit (known as Low's Peak) at metres (13,435 ft) above sea level, which some 6 metres (20 ft) less than the previously thought and hitherto published figure of 4,101 metres (13,455 ft). Mount includes the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows ecoregion in the montane grasslands and shrublands biome. The mountain and surroundings are among the most important biological sites in the world, with between 5000 6000 plants, 326 species of and more than 100 mammalian species Among this rich of wildlife are famous species such as the gigantic plants and the orangutan. Mount Kinabalu has been UNESCO World Heritage Low's be climbed quite easily by a person in good physical condition and there is no need for mountaineering equipment at any point on the main route. Other peaks along the massif, require rock skills. Mount along with other upland areas the Crocker Range is well-known worldwide for its tremendous and biological species biodiversity plants of Himalayan, Australasian, and Indomalayan A recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns), which is more than all of Europe and North America (excluding tropical regions of Mexico) combined. It is therefore one the world's most important biological sites. The flora covers the mountain zones of different types habitat as one climbs up, beginning with a lowland belt of fig trees and insectivorous pitcher plants. Then between 2,600 to m (8,530 to 10,499 ft) is of trees such the conifer Dacrydium gibbsiae and dwarf shrubs, lichens, liverworts, and ferns. Finally many of the world's richest variety of orchids are found on the high rockier slopes. These plants have levels of endemism (i.e. species which are only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). The orchids are the best-known example with over species including some the highly-valued Paphiopedilum slipper orchids, but there also over 600 species of ferns (more whole of Africa's 500 species) of 50 found nowhere else, richest collection in world for the Nepenthes pitcher plants (five of thirteen are found nowhere else on which reach spectacular proportions (the largest-pitchered in the world being the endemic Nepenthes rajah).

The term is derived from the acronym which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research. It was coined by Bill James, who is of its pioneers and is often considered its most advocate public face. principles The Sabermetric Manifesto by David Grabiner (1994) begins: Bill James defined sabermetrics as \"the search for objective knowledge about baseball.\" Thus, sabermetrics attempts to answer questions about baseball, such as \"which player on the Red Sox contributed the most to the team's offense?\" or \"How many home runs will Griffey hit year?\" It cannot deal with the subjective judgments which are also important to the game, such as \"Who is your favorite player?\" or \"That was a great game.\" It may, however, attempt settle such as \"Was Willie Mays faster than Mantle?\" by establishing several possible parameters for examining speed objective studies (how many triples each man hit, how many bases each man stole, many times he was caught stealing) and then reaching tentative conclusion on the basis these studies. Sabermetricians frequently question traditional measures of baseball skill. For instance, they doubt that batting average is as as conventional wisdom it is because team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for team Sabermetric reasoning would say that runs ballgames, and a good measure of a worth is his ability to help his score more the opposing team. This may imply that RBI (runs batted in) is an effective metric; however, sabermetricians also reject RBI, for number of reasons. Rather, sabermetric measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins. For example, player might be described as being worth 54 offensive runs more than a replacement-level player at the same position over the course of a full season, as the sabermetric statistic VORP can indicate. Sabermetrics is both with determining the value of a player or team in current or seasons with attempting to predict the value a player or team in the Many areas of study still in development, specifically in the of performance measurement.

This surpasses the 10% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress, 9 out of 14 terrestrial biomes. Such uniform targets based on area become deeply into national and international conservation planning. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value these targets have questioned. In practice, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine global data sets on the distribution of species and protected to provide the first gap analysis assessing the protected areas in species diversity.

As noted, bridging occurs the link (see 5.1), which provides physical addressing, manages to physical medium, controls data flow, and handles transmission Bridges analyze incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on the source and destination addresses of those frames, and forward the frames to their destinations. Sometimes, as in source-route bridging, the frame contains the entire path to the destination. In other as in transparent bridging, frames are forwarded one hop at a toward the destination. Figure 5.1: Bridge functionality in reference to the OSI model. Bridges can be local or remote. bridges direct connections between many LAN segments in the same area. Remote bridges connect segments in different areas, over telecommunication There are several kinds of bridging and all may be in same device: bridging —used mostly in environments that have same media types, these bridges keep a table of destination addresses and bridging —used mostly in token-ring these bridges only frames based on the routing indicator the frame. End stations are responsible for determining and maintaining table of destination addresses and routing indicators. bridging —used to bridge data between different media types, devices typically go between Ethernet and FDDI token ring to Ethernet. Source-route translation bridging —this is combination of source-route bridging and transparent bridging that communication in mixed Ethernet environments. (Translation bridging without routing indicators between token ring Ethernet is also called source-route transparent bridging.) The engine for transparent bridging is the tree algorithm (STA), which dynamically discovers a loop-free subset of network’s topology. The STA accomplishes this by placing active bridge ports that create loops into a standby or blocked condition. A blocked port can provide redundancy in if the primary port fails, it can be activated to take the traffic load. The spanning tree calculation is triggered when the bridge powered up and whenever a change in topology is detected . A topology change might occur when a forwarding port is going down (blocking) or when a port transitions to forwarding and bridge has designated which indicates that the bridge is not standalone. Configuration messages known as bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) actually trigger the spanning calculation. These are exchanged between bridges at regular set by the network usually 1 to 4 seconds. Once change in topology detected, this information must be shared with all bridges on the network. This is a two-step process that starts a bridge notifies the root of the spanning tree by it a special BPDU known as a topology change notification (TCN). The bridge sends out over its root port. The root bridge acknowledges the message by sending back a normal configuration BPDU with topology change acknowledgment (TCA) bit set. The second step in the topology entails the root bridge sending out configuration BPDUs with the topology change (TC) bit These BPDUs are relayed by every bridge, so they can become aware of the changed topology. are some with spanning tree. The more hosts on the network, higher the probability of topology changes. For example, a directly attached host, such as a client or server, will trigger a topology change when powered off, then go on to clear an operating system problem.

Generally, white wines are higher in acid than reds, for aesthetic reasons. Sweet wines should be the highest of all, offset the sweetness, or the wine will be cloying. Cool climates usually wines of high acid compared to warm climates because heat causes the sugar to go up and acid to go down. A Chardonnay from Burgundy, France almost always higher in acid than a Napa Valley Chardonnay because the difference in climate. Imagine trying to ripen tomatoes in a cold climate–they be quite tart! Titration is a simple color-change test. I’ve paraphrased this from a wine text: Titration is process of determining the concentration of a substance, such as acid, in a solution by adding carefully measured standard reagent (usually sodium hydroxide) until a reaction (change in color) occurs due the presence an indicator (phenolphthalein). Most home winemakers buy inexpensive kits to do this. I hope this you. Are you studying",

As the long, hot days of summer approach, it is helpful to review the of warm weather on the human body, the illnesses that may result and can do. How body stays cool Unknowingly, you your body in the life-and-death struggle to disperse the heat it produces. If allowed accumulate, this heat would quickly increase your body beyond its comfortable This does not happen because body is able to lose enough heat to a steady temperature. become aware of this struggle for heat balance hard labor or exercise in hot environments, when your body produces heat than it can lose it. Under certain conditions, your body may build up too much your temperature may rise to life-threatening levels, and you may become delirious or lose consciousness. This is called heat stroke, it is a serious emergency. If you do not rid your of excess heat enough, it cooks the brain other vital organs. It often is fatal, and those who survive may have permanent damage to their vital organs. Before your temperature reaches heat-stroke levels, you may suffer heat exhaustion with its flu-like symptoms, and treating its symptoms you avoid heat stroke. How does your body dispose of excess heat? lose heat largely through their skin, to how a car loses heat through its radiator. Exercising muscles warms the blood, just as a car's hot warms radiator fluid. Warm travels the skin's dilated vessels losing heat by evaporating sweat to the surrounding air, just like a loses engine heat through its radiator. When blood delivers heat to the skin, two of the important ways the body loses heat are and evaporation (vaporization of sweat). the temperature is 70oF or less, the body releases its radiation. As environmental temperatures approach body you less through radiation. fact, people working on hot summer days actually gain heat through radiation from the sun. This leaves evaporation as only way to effectively control body temperature. Water Your is about half water. You lose about 2 quarts every (breathing, urinating, bowel movements and A working adult can produce 2 quarts sweat hour for short periods and up to 15 quarts day. Because the body's water absorption rate of 1.5 quarts per hour is less the body's 2 quarts per hour sweat rate, dehydration results. This happens because you enough water to keep up with your sweat losses. you drink only when are you are dehydrated Thirst is not a good guide when to drink water. In fact, in and humid conditions, you may be so dehydrated by the time become thirsty that you have trouble catching up with your losses. One guideline regarding your water intake is to monitor urine. You are getting enough water if you produce clear urine at least five times a day. Cloudy or dark urine, urinating less than a day, means you should In the Gulf War, American forces followed the practice of the Israeli army: drinking a minimum of 1 quart of fluid per hour.

Many neighboring countries combine their resources under the auspices of organizations, create defensive alliances, and cooperate on a array of issues. The goal of unions is to preserve peace, control the arms race, resolve diplomacy, promote socioeconomic development, and protect fundamental human rights and democracy.

The creation of free trade zones, regional trade agreements, abolished customs controls, even a common currency the the future of member states. Defensive pacts enable member states to reduce military and to divert those resources cultural and educational fields. A similar organization will provide considerable benefits to Muslim nations. For those that are desperate for technological as well as economic development, the step toward stability is the creation of a central organization or, in other words, a unified Islamic world under the auspices of the Islamic Union. Economic Development and Increasing Economic cooperation is on two counts: stability development. Muslim nations must bring stability and solidity to their economies. Developing industries and making the required investments is vital, as is the need for a comprehensive development plan and the development of education, economy, culture, science, and technology. While various sectors are developed technologically, the labor force's educational levels standards must be raised accordingly. Society must be motivated to become more productive, and resulting economic cooperation will play a major role in eradicating poverty, illiteracy, the unjust distribution of wealth, other socioeconomic problems rampant in Muslim countries.

Maybe they were out of a carriage earlier in the week and bumped their head on the door causing a very mild head What if in present day your bumped against the driver’s side window in a small accident with no other injury? Could that genuinely affect anyone’s overall health? A new study by Dr. Sylvia coming out of the American Headache Society‘s Annual Meeting, states that those who experience milder head injuries tend to have more post-traumatic headaches as time progresses than those severe injuries. of the 598 participants the study “about 70% [were] more likely than … their counterparts with or severe injury to develop new headache or have a worsening of preexisting headache over the next year,” Dr Lucas quoted as saying.

They do not know why occurs, but Dr. Lucas it is related the mechanics of the accident that caused the head injury. Breaking down the participants: 220 had mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and began the the same week their accident; the other 378 had moderate to traumatic brain and were admitted to facilities. They found migraines and headaches were most common, and that headaches were common. This was unexpected considering of incidents that led to the TBI from motor vehicle accidents. “Study results showed that the TBI group and the moderate or severe TBI group had an identical prevalence of headache before injury (17%). But the former had a higher incidence of new or worsened headache (56% vs. 40%), at 3 months (63% 37%), at 6 months (69% vs. 33%), and at 12 months (58% vs. 34%).” If you are how this might severely affect somebody’s life, about a year ago story came out soldiers were sidelined more from than from other types of wounds.

Here we mostly undertake to explain to using Inform, leave the questions of craft for elsewhere. two There are two interlinked manuals into every copy of the Inform application: if you've downloaded Inform, you already have them. they are also available to read or download separately from website. Writing with Inform is an overview of the language, beginning with the simplest kinds of construction (such as building a map of objects, and doors) and working its way up to more advanced tasks. It is meant to be read more or less sequentially, since later chapters build on the ideas in earlier ones; though some of the late (such as those covering numbers, activities, or advanced text) reasonably be read out of order.

For in the Charles M. and Martha Hitchcock Lecture series, Chomsky examined - the study of relations between physiology and speech. A second video of Chomsky is featured below, which is the second half of this talk. Fair - this is not easy material - Chomsky is speaking to people who are well-versed in this field. Chomsky has been one most influential scholars over last three or four decades - between 1980 and 1992, he was cited as a source more than any other living scholar, ranked eighth overall. As background for this lecture, Wikipedia offers a good summary of his influence in linguistics (below video). Chomskyan LinguisticsChomskyan linguistics, beginning with his Syntactic Structures, distillation of his Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1955, 75), challenges structural linguistics and introduces transformational grammar. This approach takes utterances (sequences of words) to have a syntax characterized by a formal grammar; in particular, a context-free with transformational rules. Perhaps his most influential and time-tested contribution to field, is the claim that modeling knowledge of language using a grammar accounts for the \"productivity\" or \"creativity\" of language. In other words, a formal grammar a language can explain ability of a hearer-speaker to produce and interpret an infinite number of utterances, including novel ones, with a limited of grammatical rules and a finite set of terms. He has always acknowledged his debt to Pāṇini for his modern notion of an generative grammar although it is also to rationalist ideas of a priori knowledge. It is popular misconception that proved that language innate and discovered \"universal grammar\" (UG). In fact, Chomsky simply observed that while a baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human child will always acquire the to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever the relevant capacity the human has which the cat lacks the \"language device\" (LAD) and suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to figure out what the LAD is and what constraints it puts on the range of possible human The universal features that would result from these constraints are often termed \"universal grammar\" or UG. The Principles and Parameters approach (P&P)—developed in his Pisa 1979 Lectures, later on and Binding (LGB)—makes strong claims regarding universal grammar: that the grammatical principles underlying languages are innate and and differences among the world's languages be characterized in terms parameter in brain (such as the pro-drop parameter, indicates whether an explicit is always required, as English, or can be optionally dropped, as in Spanish), which are often likened to the term principles and parameters, given this In view, a child learning a language need only the necessary lexical items (words, grammatical morphemes, and idioms), and determine the appropriate parameter settings, can be based on a few key examples. Proponents of view argue that at which children learn is inexplicably rapid, unless children have an innate ability to learn languages. The similar steps followed by children all across the world when learning languages, and the fact make certain characteristic errors as they learn their first language, whereas other seemingly logical kinds of errors never occur (and, according to Chomsky, should be attested if a purely general, rather than learning mechanism were being employed), are also pointed to as motivation for innateness. More recently, in his Minimalist Program (1995), while retaining the core concept of \"principles and parameters,\" Chomsky attempts a major linguistic machinery involved in the LGB model, stripping it all but the elements, while a general approach to the architecture of the human language faculty that emphasizes principles of economy and optimal design, reverting to a derivational approach to generation, in contrast with the largely representational approach of classic P&P. Chomsky's ideas had a strong influence on of the language acquisition in children, many in this area such Elizabeth Bates and Michael Tomasello argue very strongly Chomsky's theories, and instead advocate emergentist or connectionist theories, explaining language with a number of general processing mechanisms in th",

Production companies often methods to reduce the rendering times and retain the overall quality. It worth pointing out that usage of Occlusion(i.e. AO) as a separate pass or/and directly from Max is utterly for the final shot. The following exercise will take you through another methodology of achieving similar results with rendering times: Another quick way emulating “glow”/\"light\" on windows, is to in enable the glow function on the glass panes themselves. To do this, simply go to the main material parameters, under the \"refraction\" group. 1-Reduce the transparency to about 0.9 to prevent surface from being fully transparent. 2-To add bit blur to the transparency, decrease the glossiness to about 0.78. Note that, these values may vary depending on one’s camera angle...and the level of transparency/blurriness intended. 3-Next,change the swatch from white a yellow. Also, the \"fast (interpolate)\" function, can be enabled for and fast results, as the and samples can slow down renders.However,it may create artifacts. down to the \"self illumination (glow)\" parameters and enable the \"self illumination (glow)\" function. 5-Under the \"luminance\" group, change it \"unitless\" to \"physical units: cd/m2)\". Also, pick and choose any relevant bitmap photo) that has a light source. Note: The \"unitless\" function often creates artifacts on glossy reflections, therefore, to be avoided at all costs. Depending on time in hand, one can set the glow to generate light, or through the FG, by checking the \"illuminates the scene (when using fg)\" ...and... “...let there light...”!!!

The length of time between exposure and sick (called the incubation period) depends on many factors, particularly the type of pneumonia involved.

They might disagree about big things — like important decisions need to make the family. They might about little things that don't seem important at all — like what's for dinner or what gets home. parents can disagree with each other and still manage to talk about it in a calm way, where both people get a chance to listen and to talk. But many times when disagree, they argue. An argument is a fight using Most kids worry when their parents argue. Loud voices and angry words parents might use can make kids feel scared, sad, or upset. Even arguments that use silence — like parents act angry and don't each other at all — can be upsetting for kids. If the argument anything to do with the kids, kids might think they have caused parents to argue and fight. If kids think it's fault, they might feel guilty or upset. But parents' behavior is never the fault of kids. What Does It Mean Parents Fight? Kids often worry what it means when parents fight. They jump to conclusions and arguments mean their parents don't love each other anymore. They might it means their parents will get a divorce.

This view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely, whether the of a character, which first inherited by both sexes can be limited in its transmission to one sex alone by means of natural selection. We must bear in mind, as shewn in the preliminary chapter sexual selection, that characters which limited in their development to sex are always latent in the other. illustration will best aid us in the difficulty of the case; we may suppose that a fancier wished to make a breed of pigeons, in which the males be coloured of a pale blue, whilst the females retained their former slaty tint. with pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted both sexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. All that he could do would be to persevere in selecting every male pigeon which was in the least degree of a paler blue; the natural result of this process, if steadily carried on for a long time, and if the pale variations were strongly inherited or often recurred, would to make his whole stock of a lighter blue. But fancier would be compelled to match, generation after generation, his pale blue males with slaty for he wishes to keep the latter of this colour. result would generally the production either of a mongrel piebald lot, or more probably the speedy and complete loss of the tint; for the primordial colour would be transmitted with prepotent force. Supposing, however, some pale-blue and slaty were produced each successive and were always crossed together, then the females would have, if I use much blue blood their veins, for fathers, grandfathers, &c., will have been blue birds. these circumstances it is conceivable (though I know of distinct facts rendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, they would not destroy this colour their male offspring, their offspring still the slaty tint. If the desired end of making a breed the two sexes permanently might be gained. The extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the desired character, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent in the female, so that the male offspring should be deteriorated, be best appreciated as the male of Soemmerring's pheasant has tail in length, whilst that of the is only eight inches; the tail of the male common is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches long. Now if the female Soemmerring pheasant with her short tail were crossed with the male common pheasant, there can be no doubt that the male hybrid offspring would a much longer tail than that of the pure offspring of common On the other hand, female common with a tail longer than that of the Soemmerring pheasant, were crossed with male the latter, the male hybrid offspring would have a shorter tail than that of pure offspring of Soemmerring's pheasant.* * Temminck says that the tail of the female Phasianus is only six inches lo",

Typically hydroceles develop testicle passes into the scrotum but passage through which this occur fails close properly. Fluid accumulate in this passage from the abdomen, and then enters the scrotum causing it to swell. This can cause one or both sides of the scrotum to swell the testicle itself to swell or become damage and inflamed. Fluid can also block the tube where sperm typically flow from. Hydroceles are newborn boys but exclusive to newborn boys. To diagnose a hydrocele typically a doctor will look for swelling in the scrotum caused primarily by build up or will look for something solid like a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum. Typically fluid is removed from the hydrocele sac during a procedure called hydrocelectomy. For the most part this is a straightforward uncomplicated procedure that may a amount of soreness for a few days following the procedure. The benefits far outweigh any short-term soreness. Many times the patient is a under the age of 10 or in many cases a baby that is born with a hydrocele defect. Usually a surgery takes placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon will a small incision in the scrotum will allow fluid to be drained from scrotum and seal the passage from the scrotum to the abdomen. Usually the incision is closed with stitches that will dissolve on their own so they not have to be removed later. Alternatives to Surgery There are no alternatives to this currently. Before the Operation Prior to the operation the doctor will confirm fluid filled sac exists by placing a light to the will light up testicles, veins in the scrotum and the fluid sac which will appear clear to the light. A doctor will also perform a comprehensive medical history and check any medications the patient is currently taking. Patients are not to eat or drink anything up to 12 hours before the because it is performed under general anesthesia. After the Operation- At Home Once the operation is complete the patient will recover usually for a few hours in a day bed. The procedure is usually performed on an outpatient basis meaning the patient can usually go home on the day.

There are risks associated this procedure as are with any procedure including a small risk of infection. Other risks including the risk of bleeding during after the and a risk of a blood clot forming the area of the The doctor may accidentally damage the scrotum or the tissues surrounding this area too. Anytime a undergoes general anesthesia there are risks associated with this too a risk of pneumonia following surgery. The nurse doctor will encourage patient to take deep breaths to clear lungs following surgery. Many people especially younger children undergoing this operation may report feeling nauseous or dizzy following the procedure, a side effect largely associated with the general anesthesia. These complications are usually temporary however and resolve within a couple of days of treatment. A hydrocele procedure is generally to relieve fluid build up around the testicle within the scrotum. This procedure relatively with few complications. primary risks include a of infection and risk rupture or nicks to nearby tissues or structures.

Because these surgeries are often performed on younger it pays to ask someone they have experience working on youths or pediatric patients. You need to pay a small amount extra to work with someone in pediatrics even if you are over 50 or 60 and have a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum that you require surgery for.

What can you change to make things more inviting? you’d like to encourage some more reading, perhaps could up a cosy reading corner or – with comfy cushions, a basket of tempting books a favourite teddy to share with? If your toy kitchen has been ignored for a while, add some resources to catch your child’s eye: a muffin tin and paper cases, some jars of real dried pasta, a recipe from your shelf or lay the for a birthday and your child with a new play possibility. Do you sometimes review things from your child’s point of view? What changes have you made to make your more child- and play- Leave a and share an idea with us. I’m writing this one o’clock in afternoon and the sky is grey and rain is tumbling down. making me think about how the affects our play, and particularly I’m thinking about how time we spend outdoors in autumn and winter. I don’t think there’s any question that playing outside is wonderful children: the fresh air, the feeling of space, the sensory benefits of being in I know with own two girls, and all the children I’ve looked after, that if we’re having a grumpy sort of day, getting outside – in the garden, park or just for walk – often is all that’s needed to lighten everyone’s mood. But it’s getting colder now, and windy and rainy dark. If you’re the type who is happy to be outside all the time in all weathers, I really do salute you. I however naturally to prefer a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket inside! We do play outside everyday, whatever the weather, but there’s denying we play outdoors less in winter – which I’m guessing is the same for lots of So, I’m to put more thought into getting out there and planning on bringing you some posts over next few months that inspire us to venture out. I’d also like to invite you to share your ideas too. The Play Academy carnival on Friday is open to any of your posts and I’d also love to from if you’d like to write a guest post any play in fact, not just playing outside.

If wearing the right clothes, you’re much more likely to enjoy your time outside. Pretty much all the children I know care if it’s cold, windy or raining – they active kids and just love being outside. So, to help everyone enjoy outside, and to stop you cutting short the children’s outdoor fun because you’ve had enough, my first tip is to make sure you are wearing the right clothes.

PROFESSOR: In the meantime, you've started looking at two phase now to look at mixtures. And so now we have more than one constituent. And have more than phase present. Right? you've to look at things that look this, where you've got, let's say, two components. Both in the gas phase. And now to try to out the phase equilibria look like. Of course it's now a little bit more complicated than what you went through before, where you can get pressure temperature phase diagrams with just single component. Now we want to about what's the composition. Of each of the components. In each of the phases. And what's the temperature and the pressure. Total partial and all of that. you can figure out everything about both phases. And there are all sorts of important reasons to that, obviously lots of chemistry happens in liquid mixtures. Some in gas mixtures. Some where they're in All sorts of chemical processes. Distillation, for example, takes of the properties of liquid gas mixtures. Where one of them might be will richer, and the more volatile of the components. That be as a basis for purification. You ethanol and water together so you've a liquid a composition each. The gas to be richer and the more volatile of the two, the ethanol. So in a distillation, where you put things up in the gas, more of the ethanol up. You could then collect that gas, right? re-condense it, and make a new liquid. Which is much richer in ethanol than the liquid was. Then you could make, then you could put some of them into the gas Where it will be still richer in ethanol. then could collect that and the process. the is that properties liquid gas, two-component or multi-component mixtures like this can be exploited. Basically, the different volatilities different components can be exploited for things like purification. Also if you to chemical equilibria in the liquid and gas phase, of course, now you've chemical equilibrium, so the amount of reaction on the composition. So of course you want reactions to go, then this also be by looking at which phase might be richer in one reactant or another. And thereby pushing equilibrium toward one direction or the other. OK. So. we've some total and pressure. And we have compositions. So in the gas phase, we've got mole fractions yA and yB. In the liquid phase we've got mole fractions xA and xB. So that's our system. One of the that you established last time is that, so there are the number of variables including the temperature and the pressure. And let's say the mole fraction of A in each of the liquid and gas phases, right? But then there are constraints. Because the chemical potentials to be equal, right? Chemical potential of A has to be equal in the liquid and gas. Same Those constraints reduce the number of variables. So there'll be two in this case rather than four variables. you control those, then everything else follow. What that means is you've got a, if you control, if you fix the temperature and the total pressure, everything else should determinable. No more free variables. And then, what you saw is that in simple or ideal liquid mixtures, a result called Raoult's law would hold. Which just says that the partial pressure of A is equal to the mole fraction of A in the liquid times the pressure of pure A over the liquid. And so what this gives you is diagram like this. we plot this versus xB, this is mole fraction of B in the liquid going from zero to one. Then we could a diagram of this sort. So this is the total pressure of A B. The partial pressures are given by these lines. So this is our pA star and pB star. The pressures over the pure liquid A and B at the limits of mole fraction of being zero and one. So this situation, example, the more volatile of the components. So it's partial pressure over its pure liquid. At this temperature. Is higher than the partial pressure B over its pure liquid. A would be the ethanol, for example and B the water in that mixture. OK. Then you started looking the gas and the liquid phase in the same diagram. So this is the mole fraction of the liquid. If you look and see, well, OK should be able to determine the mole fraction the as well. i",

PROFESSOR: Last lecture we were talking about classes, object-oriented programming, we're going to come back to it today. I'm going to remind you, we were talking about it because we suggested it is a really powerful of structuring systems, and that's really why we want to it, It's a very common way of structuring systems. So today I'm going to pick up on more nuanced, or more complex if you like, ways of leveraging the power of classes. we're to see a bunch examples that are going to give us a sense. I'm going talk about inheritance, we're going to talk about we're going to talk about iterators. get to it, I want to start by just highlighting, sort of, was the point classes? So I'll remind you. A class, I said, was basically a template for an abstract data type. And this was really to drive home this of modularity. I want the ability to say, I've a set of things that naturally belong together, I'm going to them together, I want to treat like it's a primitive, I to treat it like it's a float or an int or a string. Is this going to be a point or a segment or something different like that. So it's really a way, as I of just trying to cluster data together. And this is a notion modularity slash abstraction where I'm treating them as primitives. But the second thing talked about is we also have a set of methods, using the special name method because we're talking But basically functions that are designed to deal with data structure. We're trying to group as well. So we cluster data Second key thing we said was, in the ideal case, unfortunately Python isn't, but we'll back to that, in the ideal case, we would have data hiding, and by data hiding, which is sort of a version encapsulation, what we meant was that could only get to the internal pieces that data structure through a proscribed method. Proscribed meaning something I set up. data hiding saying, you would access the parts through a method. And as said, unfortunately Python does not enforce this. Meaning that I could create one of these data structures, ideally I'd have a method, that I'm going to see some examples of that I used to the parts unfortunately in Python you could take the name the instance dot some variable you'll get it back. It is exposed. And this is actually just a good idea. So I in my very humor, that you practice computational and you only use appropriate methods to get the out. OK didn't laugh the joke last time, you're not going laugh at it this time, I don't blame you. All right, and then the last piece of this is that we said the is a template. we that class, it makes an instance. So class is used to make meaning particular versions, of that structure, and we inside the instances we have a of attributes. variables, methods, are going to belong to that structure. OK, so mind, here's what I want to do. I'm going to you a set of examples, I want to warn you ahead of time, the code handout is a longer than normal because we want to build essentially an extended example of a sequence of examples classes. We're going to see the idea, which we're gonna talk about, of inheritance or hierarchy, in which we can have classes that are specializations of We're gonna see how we can inherit methods, how we can shadow methods, how use methods in a variety of ways. So this is a way of suggesting you may find convenient to put notes on the code handout rather than in your own notes. whatever like, but I just wanted to alert you, we're going to go through a little more code than normal. So, the little environment I'm going to build is an environment of people. I'll a simple little simulation of people. So I'm to start off with the first class, which I've got up on the and it's on your handout as well, which is I'm going to build instance, or a class rather, of persons. I'm to draw a diagram, I'm try and see if I can do well, over here, of the different objects we're going to So I've and by the way a class is an object. Instances are also objects, but classes are objects. We're gonna see why we want that in a second. Because I'm gonna build an object, sorry class, called a person. Now, walk through some of the pieces",

Why was Caldecott so important? Here’s an answer from Maurice who won the Caldecott Medal for Where the Wild Things Are: “Caldecott’s work heralds the beginning the modern picture book. He devised an ingenious juxtaposition picture and a counterpoint that had never happened Words are out – but the picture says Pictures are left out but the word says it. In short, it is the invention of picture book.” * * * “My favorite example of Caldecott’s fearless honesty is the final page of Hey Diddle Diddle. we read, ‘And the Dish ran away with spoon,’ accompanied by a drawing of the happy couple, is the shock of turning the page finding a picture of the broken into ten pieces – obviously dead – and the being hustled away by her angry parents. There are words that suggest such an end to the adventure; it is purely a Caldecottian invention. Apparently, he could not resist enlarging the dimensions of this nursery adding a last sorrowful Sendak in Caldecott & Co.: Notes Books & Pictures (Farrar, Straus and 1988), a collection of Sendak’s reviews and other writing for adults. The first quote comes from his “Randolph Caldecott” and the from his acceptance speech the 1964 Caldecott Medal. Sendak is one the few great picture-book artists who is also a critic.

Deep rooted crucifereous crops were have high root densities to a depth of 1.5-2 m and high uptake to this depth. work shows that knowledge the interactions between root growth soil N below a depth of m are important to understand crop N uptake and nitrate leaching from agro-ecosystems. |EPrint Type:||Conference paper, poster, etc.| |Type of presentation:||Paper| |Subjects:|| Soil > Nutrient turnover| Crop husbandry Crop combinations and interactions Crop husbandry > Production systems > Vegetables |Research affiliation:|| Denmark > DARCOF III (2005-2010) > VEGQURE - Organic Systems for Vegetable production| > AU - Aarhus University > AU, DJF - Faculty of Agricultural Sciences |Deposited By:||Kristensen, Ph.D. Hanne |Deposited On:||28 Nov 2007| |Last Modified:||12 Apr 07:35| |Refereed:||Peer-reviewed and accepted| Repository Staff Only: control page",

It is one of four metals -- mercury, cesium, and rubidium -- which can be liquid near room temperature and, thus, can be in high-temperature thermometers. It has one of the longest liquid ranges of any metal and has a low at high temperatures. There is a strong tendency for gallium to supercool below its freezing point. Therefore, seeding may be necessary to initiate solidification. Ultra-pure gallium has a beautiful, silvery appearance, and the solid metal exhibits a conchoidal fracture to glass. The metal expands 3.1 percent on solidifying; therefore, it should not be stored in glass or metal containers, because they may break as the metal solidifies. High-purity gallium is attacked only slowly by mineral acids. Gallium wets glass or porcelain and forms a mirror when it is painted on glass.

In this narrative, the nineteenth century's absence is conspicuous--few have considered that era much less written books on it. But as Jenny Martinez shows in this novel interpretation of the roots of human rights law, the foundation of the movement that we know today was a product of of nineteenth century's central moral causes: the movement to ban the international slave trade. Originating in England in the late eighteenth century, abolitionism achieved remarkable success over the course of the nineteenth century. Martinez focuses in particular on the international admiralty courts, which tried the crews of captured ships. The courts, which were based in the Caribbean, West Africa, Cape Town, and Brazil, helped at least 80,000 Africans from captured slavers 1807 and 1871. Here then, buried in the dusty archives of ships' logs, the British foreign office, are the foundations of contemporary law: international courts targeting states and transnational actors while working on the world's most persecuted West Africans bound for the slave plantations the Americas. by a powerful thesis and novel evidence, Martinez's work will reshape the fields of human rights history and human rights law. - Forces us to fundamentally rethink the origins of human rights activism - Filled with stories of captured slave ship crews brought to across the Atlantic world in the nineteenth century - Shows the prosecution of the international slave trade was crucial to the development of modern international law",

With of electromagnetic technology, mysterious messages have been communicated by wireless, phonographs and radio. A curious phenomenon of modern is the via the telephone. Phone calls from the dead seem to be random and occasional occurrences that happen without explanation. The great majority are shared a close emotional tie while both were living: spouses, parents and children, siblings, occasionally friends other relatives. Most communications are \"intention\" calls, initiated by deceased impart a message, such as farewell upon death, a warning of impending danger, information living needs to carry out a task. For example, actress Ida father, Stanley, who died intestate in London World War II, called Lupino six months after his death to relate information concerning his estate, the location of some unknown but Some calls appear to have other purpose than to make contact with the living; many these on emotionally \"anniversary\" such as Mothers day or Fathers a birthday or holiday. In a typical” anniversary” call, the dead do nothing more than repeat a phrase over and over, such as \"Hello, Mom, is that you?\" Persons who have received phone calls from the dead that the voices are exactly the same as when the deceased was the voice often uses pet names and words.

Few argue the that the institutions of the mass media important to contemporary politics. In the transition to liberal democratic politics in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the media was a key battleground. the West, elections increasingly focus around television, with the emphasis on spin and marketing. Democratic places emphasis the mass media as a site for democratic demand and the “public opinion”. The media are seen to empower citizens, and subject government to restraint and redress. Yet the media are just neutral observers but are political themselves. The interaction of mass and political actors — politicians, interest groups, and who play important roles — in the political is apparent. this framework, the American arena can be as a dynamic environment in which communication, particularly journalism in its forms, substantially influences and is influenced it. According the theory of democracy, people rule. The pluralism of different political parties provides people with “alternatives,” and and when one party loses their confidence, can support another. The democratic principle of “government of the people, by the people, and the people” would be nice if it were all so simple. But in medium-to-large modern state things are not quite like that. Today, several elements contribute to the shaping of the public’s political discourse, including the goals and success of public and strategies used by politically engaged individuals and the rising influence of new media technologies such as the Internet. A naive assumption of liberal democracy is that citizens have adequate knowledge of political events. But how do citizens acquire the information and knowledge necessary for them to use their votes other than by blind guesswork? They cannot possibly everything that is happening on the national scene, still less the level of events. The vast majority are not students of politics. They don’t really know what is happening, and even if they did would need guidance as to how interpret what they knew. Since the early twentieth century this has been fulfilled through media. Few today in States can say that they do not have access to at least form of the mass media, yet political knowledge is remarkably low. Although political information is through the of mass media, different critics support that events are shaped and frames are constructed by politicians and news casters, and ownership influences between political actors and the provide important short hand cues to how to interpret understand news. One must not forget another interesting fact about the media. Their political influence extends far beyond newspaper reports and articles of a direct political or television programs connected with current affairs that bear politics. In a much more subtle they can influence people’s patterns by other means, like “goodwill” stories, pages with entertainment and popular culture, movies, TV “soaps”, “educational” these types of information form human values, concepts of good and evil, right and wrong, sense and what is “fashionable” “unfashionable,” and what is “acceptable” and “unacceptable”.

Also, resist the urge to surprise a friend or family member with a living gift. Choosing the right pet is extremely personal decision, one that be made carefully by the adults who will be caring for the animal for its 15- 20-year lifetime.

Best Friends offers tips and advice to help make a smooth transition at home: * Determine roles and Before bringing home a new pet, discuss what roles and each family member will take on. Who will be in charge of feeding, walks, changing litter box and taking your pet for regular visits to the vet? Giving each family member a specific task will help everyone feel involved, especially young * Prep the house – Adding a pet to the house means new items to your shopping lists. For dogs, basics are a collar and leash, toys, a kennel and dog Cats a litter box and litter, a scratching post and a carrying crate Also don’t forget food and toys. * Have your pet spayed/neutered – or neutering is one of the greatest gifts can provide your pet and community.

Their concern came, no doubt, from the recent of eulogies play . Educators fret that school are hacking at recess to make room for an increasingly crammed Psychologists complain that overscheduled have no time for the real business of childhood: idle, creative, unstructured free play.

And everyone seems to worry that without the chance to play stickball or hopscotch out on the street, to play with on the kitchen or climb trees the woods, today's children missing out on something essential. The ''The Dangerous Book for Boys'' -- which has been on the best-seller list for the last nine months -- and its instructions activities like folding airplanes is testament to the generalized longing for play's good old days. So were the questions after Stuart Brown's talk; one woman asked how her children will learn trust, empathy and social skills when their frequent playing is Brown told her that while video games do have some play value, a true of ''interpersonal nuance'' can be achieved by a child is engaging all five senses by playing the three-dimensional world.

Discussions about play force us to reckon our underlying ideas about childhood, sex differences, creativity and success. Do boys play differently than girls? Are children being damaged by staring at computer screens and video games? Are they missing something when fantasy play is populated with characters from imagination and not own? Most of these are vast to be addressed by a single field of study (let alone a magazine article). But the growing science of play does much to add to the conversation. Armed with research grounded in biology and experimental neuroscience, some scientists have shown themselves eager -- at times perhaps little too eager -- to promote scientific argument for They spent past few decades learning how and why play in animals, generating insights that can inform our understanding of its evolution in humans too. They are studying, from an evolutionary perspective, to what extent play is a luxury that can be dispensed with when there are many other competing claims on growing brain, and to what extent it is central to that brain grows in the first place. Scientists who study play, in animals and humans alike, are developing consensus view that is something than a way for kids to work off steam; more than a way for chubby kids to burn off calories; more than a frivolous luxury. Play, their view, is a central part of neurological growth and development -- one important way that children build complex, responsive, socially adept and cognitively flexible brains.

By 2010, all jobs will require some form of technological literacy, and 80% of those jobs haven?t even been created yet. We must prepare our students for a world that we ourselves cannot completely anticipate. This require the active involvement of scientists and engineers. How is NSF seeking to encourage scientists to work on educational issues? The NSF Strategic Plan includes two relevant goals: to \"a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged workforce scientists, engineers, and well-prepared citizens\" and to support \"discovery across the frontiers of science and engineering, connected to learning, innovation, and service to society.\" To realize both of these goals, our nation?s scientists and must care about the educational implications their work and explore educational issues as seriously and knowledgeably as they do research questions. The phrase \"integration of research and education\" conveys two ideas. First, good generates an educational asset, we must effectively use that asset. Second, we need to encourage more scientists engineers to pursue research careers that focus on teaching and learning their own disciplines. proposals submitted to NSF for funding must address two merit criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. In everyday our to evaluating broader impact of proposals is built on the philosophy that scientists and engineers should pay attention to teaching and it, and that their institutions should recognize, support, and reward faculty, as well in and industry, who take their role as educators seriously and approach instruction as a scholarly act. We think of education very broadly, including formal (K-graduate and study) and informal education (efforts to promote public understanding of science and research outside the traditional educational environment). What does it mean to take education seriously and explore it knowledgeably? Any scholarly approach education must be intentional, be based on a valid body of knowledge, and be rigorously assessed. That is, our approach to educational questions must be a scholarly act. NSF actively invests in educational reform models that encourage scientists and engineers to improve curriculum, teaching, and learning in science mathematics at all levels of the educational system from elementary school to and work. We recognize that to interest faculty and practicing scientists and in education, we must support that generates convincing evidence that changing how we approach the teaching of science and mathematics will pay off in better learning and deeper interest in these Here are a few of the most recent efforts to stimulate interest in education that might be of interest to Wave readers.

It is also a border of Buckinghamshire. It guarded these once tribal lands in the distant past, will preserve them into the imaginable future. There are 134 along the length of the Thames, and forty-four above Teddington. There are approximately twenty tributaries still flowing into the while such as the Fleet have disappeared under the ground. Its \"basin,\" area from which it derives its water from rain and other natural forces, covers an area some 5,264 square And then there are the springs, many of them in the woods or close to the the Thames. There one in the wood below Sinodun Hills in Oxfordshire, for example, which has been described as an \"everlasting spring\" always fresh and renewed. The flow of the river at Teddington, chosen because it marks the place where the tidal and non-tidal waters touch, has been calculated at 1,145 millions of gallons (5,205 millions each day or 2,000 cubic feet cubic metres) per second. The current moves at velocity between 1Ú2 and miles per hour. The main thrust of the river flow is known hydrologists the \"thalweg\"; it does not move in a straight and forward line but, mingling with the inner flow and the flow the surface and bottom waters, takes the of a spiral or helix. More than 95 per cent of the river's is lost in and friction. The direction of the flow of the Thames therefore quixotic. It might be assumed that it would move eastwards, but it defies any simple prediction. It flows north-west above Henley and Teddington, west above Abingdon, south from Cookham above Marlow and Kingston. This has to do with the variegated curves of the river. It does not meander like the Euphrates, where according to Herodotus voyager came upon the same village three times on three separate days, but it is circuitous. specialises in loops. It will the traveller two or times as long cover the same distance as a companion on the high road. So the Thames teaches you take time, and view the world a different vantage. The average \"fall\" or of the river from its beginning to its end is approximately 17 to 21 inches (432 to 533 mm) per mile. It follows gravity, and seeks perpetually simplest way to the sea. It falls some 600 feet (183 m) from source to sea, with a relatively precipitous decline of 300 feet (91.5 m) in the first 9 miles; it falls 100 m) more in the next 11 with lower average for the rest of its course. Yet averages may not be so important. They mask the and idiosyncrasy of the Thames. The mean of the river is given as 1,000 feet (305 m), and a mean depth of 30 feet (9 m); the width varies from 1 or 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) at Trewsbury to 51Ú2 miles at the Nore.

It is one general movement but comprises a thousand different streams eddies; there are opposing streams, and high water is not necessarily the same thing as high tide. The water will begin to fall before the tide is over. The speed of the tide between 1 and knots (1.15 and miles per hour), at times of very high flow it reach 7 knots (8 miles per hour). At London the flood tide runs for almost six hours, the ebb tide endures for six hours and thirty minutes. The tides are much higher now than at other times in the history of the Thames.

If own has ever played a team sport, you likely have seen this walk a hundred times before. Win or lose, each member of the team is expected to essentially tell the other players they did well and good game. This is a classic way to end a game on a positive note and to exhibit good win or lose. The opposing team in this however, had a unique of showing their sportsmanship. They all licked hands before holding them out our own girls to \"low-five\" as they walked down the line. Our girls saw this, and they refused to the other girls' slimy, slobbery, germ-ridden hands. You may be wondering if our girls' team beat other team. truth is that they beat the other pretty harshly, but there is no score that would justify the level poor sportsmanship that the other team exhibited. As a parent, I can only hope the or on the other team reprimanded their girls for unsportsmanlike behavior. This is the kind of behavior any parent would be proud to see in own However, this is just one many unsportsmanlike behavior is exhibited. From tears on the field to pushing, shoving, \"trash and more, there are many different behaviors that are associated with poor sportsmanship. The fact is that good sportsmanship is a quality that can play a role in your child's ability to react to other situations throughout life. may occur on the field, but it also plays a part in college process, a run for a place on the school board, the job application process and so much more. Teaching your child how be a good sport now can help him or her handle wins and losses throughout life with So how can you help your child build a healthy \"win-or-lose\" attitude? A Parental Role Model No parent takes in seeing other players, either from their child's own or on the opposing team, be better than own child. Parents simply want their to be the best. However, somewhere between the desire to see your kid to aim for the stars and the truth of reality is the fact that there always will or some team that is better. As a parent, you can talk negatively about better players or better teams, or you can talk positively about them. You can use these interactions with competition to point out areas where own child can improve teach your child to respect those with and talents that worthy respect. This a great opportunity teach your child to turn lemons into You Win Some, You Lose Some Very few children really are the what they do. There is always someone who is or who is working hard to be better in the near future. A team that was on top this season may not be the top the next season. While you want your to work hard strive to win, it is unrealistic to expect child or his or her team to win all of the time. Children will inevitably be disappointed after a loss. This is understandable and justified, especially if he or she has been working hard and did his or her personal best. As parent, your response to a loss every bit as important as your to a win. The fact is that entire team can play their best, and they may simply be out-matched. Teaching kids do happen, even they try their hardest, can help them their defeat. Show them that you are proud of performance and effort at each game rather than letting the under the \"W\" column dictate this. A Lesson Learned The fact that a child or a team simply will not very when they are blowing out the competition on regular basis. To the best, have to play the best. You to be challenged by the best, and this means a loss will occur. Within each game, whether a win or loss, lies an opportunity for growth, development and improvement. After each game, regardless of the outcome, to your child about what he or did well and what he she thinks could have been better. Rather tell your child you think, ask your child his or her personal opinion on the matter what the coach said. remind your child that these are areas that he or she can work on for the next game. Nobody likes to lose, but challenge and loss are the motivators that make us all better. Whether the field, in the workplace or any number of other environments, and loss are vital to developing that trait that true in life have. trait is perseverance.Content by Kim Daugherty .",

There are the medium-sized rodents grew up with, averaging around 4 kg, and groundhogs—like a certain Phil—that probably like 14 kg. This is the likely source of my confusion, as that's huge discrepancy in size. Evidently, in the much like humans. Where I grew up, in rural Northern Minnesota, we called the groundhog a woodchuck; I thought that the groundhog was some fat cat, East Coast, liberal rodent. As it would out, they actually one in the same creature—Marmota monax, a member of the squirrel family. Woodchucks spend a lot of their time in burrows. It is their safe haven from their many predators, they are quick to it at the first sign danger. They will sometimes emit loud whistle on their way to alert others the that something is awry. Groundhogs enjoy raiding our gardens and digging sod, thereby destroying what spent countless hours toiling upon. Look for groundhog signs. You might not even there is a around until your garden been devoured or your tractor damaged by a groundhog Things to look for large nibble marks on your prized veggies, gnaw marks on the bark of young fruit trees, root vegetables pulled up (or tops off), groundhog-sized holes (25–30 cm) anywhere near your garden, or of dirt near said holes. If you see these signs, take action. Don't wait or it will be too late! If you it will be a problem and do nothing, you can't blame the animal. Set groundhog traps. This technique takes some skill as you need to be able to pick a spot in path of the animal, camouflage it, and mask your strong scent. Setting a spring trap, whether coil or long-spring, is usually just a matter of compressing the springs and setting a pin that keeps jaws open into the pan or trigger. Make sure your trap is anchored securely with a stake. Check your traps and dispatch the animal and humanely. Shooting them the or a hearty whack to the head with club will do the trick. If you can't deal this, you have no business setting traps. Call professional. Guns kill groundhogs. I have never shot a groundhog. I rarely have had problems with them, and they move so damned fast it is difficult to get a off. If I had I know how I would do it. First, be sure it is in your area, and be sure to follow gun safety protocols. After that, it's just a matter of learning where your target is going be comfortable and guard down. I would follow tracks back to their den, find a spot downwind to sit with a clear shooting lane, and make sure you shouldn't hit with a bullet down range. I would wait, my sights set on the den, until the groundhog its head up—quick and easy. Demolish the groundhog burrows. you find holes around yard, they are likely the entrances an elaborate tunnel maze carved into the earth beneath you. About all you can do, short of digging the whole mess up, is try and fill it in from the top side. First, fill it with a bunch of rocks and then soil—make sure to really pack it in. This make it difficult for the groundhog to reclaim its hole without a lot of work. You probably want to do this in tandem other control methods such as trapping, shooting, fumigating to prevent the groundhog just digging a new hole. Do some landscaping and barriers. As the control of pests, it is advisable to keep a free of brush, undercover, and dead trees. These types of features are attractive to groundhogs as cover, and without it, they are less likely to to spend time If you want to keep a out of an area, consider a partially buried fence. This require a lot of work, but it is going to help a lot. Make sure it extends up least a meter, that it is buried somewhere 30 cm deep. the fencing outward 90 degrees when you bury it, and it will make digging under it a very daunting task for your friend. Try using to kill What is nice about this product is that you can kill the animal bury it in one stroke. The best time this is in the spring when the mother will be in the den with her still helpless young. Also, the soil will likely be damp, which helps a lot. You should definitely follow directions on the package, but the way they usually work is that you cover all but one exit, set off the smoke bomb, shove it down the hole, and quickly cover it up. Check in a day or two to see if is any of activity, and if so, do it again or consider a different control It is important that you do this if the is next to your house or if there is any risk of a fire.

VSC HVDC is based transistor technology and was developed in the 1990′s. The switching element is the Insulated Gate Bipolar Thyristor (IGBT), which can be switched on and off by applying a suitable voltage to the gate (steering electrode). Because of the more switching operations, and the nature of the semiconductor devices itself, the converter losses higher than those of classic converters. VSC is commonly used with underground or submarine cables with a transfer capacity in the range of 10 1000 MW, and is suitable to serve as a connection to a wind or supply a remote load. VSC HVDC technology steer and control functionality and is suitable for meshed networks. It characterised by the converter due to the reduced need for AC filters and reactive power compensation. Power flow reversal in VSC systems is achieved by reversal of the current, whereas in HVDC classic systems the voltage polarity has to change. An important consequence of this source is the ability to use cheaper and easier to install XLPE cables, instead of the mass-impregnated cables that are needed HVDC classic. Currently, only twelve VSC HVDC in service. A few examples include: Estlink, which connects Estonia to (350 MW), and BorWin1, connecting an offshore wind farm to Northern Germany (400 MW).

Critical configuration data for each component, and relationship other components, must be accurately captured and maintained. This configuration data should include past and current states and future-state forecasts, and be easily available to those who need it. Service Asset and Configuration Management are necessary achieving predictability. A virtualized infrastructure adds complexity to the management of Configuration Items (CIs) due to the transient of the relationship between and hosts in the infrastructure. How is the relationship between CIs maintained in an environment that is changing very frequently? A service comprises software, and infrastructure layers. Each layer provides a level of abstraction that is dependent on the layer beneath it. This hides the implementation and composition details of the layer. Access to the layer is provided through an interface and as long as the fabric is available, the actual physical location of a hosted VM is irrelevant. To provide Infrastructure as a (IaaS), the configuration and relationship the components within the fabric must be understood, whereas the details of the configuration within the VMs by the fabric are irrelevant. The Configuration Management System (CMS) will need to be partitioned, at a minimum, into and logical CI layers. Two Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) might be used; one to manage the physical CIs of the fabric (facilities, network, storage, hardware, and hypervisor) and other manage the logical CIs (everything else).

Signage in Education By Anthony D. Coppedge Technology gets high marks. Digital media and communications have come to a vital role in people’s everyday lives, and a visit to the local K-12 school, college or university campus quickly illustrates the many ways in which individuals on audio and visual technologies each day. The shift from analog media to digital, by milestones ranging from the replacement of the by MP3 player to the DTV transition currently enabling broadcasts beyond the home to devices, has redefined the options that larger institutions, including those in our educational system, have for sharing information across the campus and facilities. Flexible And Efficient Digital signage, in particular, is proving to be a flexible and efficient tool delivering specific and up-to-date information within the environment. As a high-resolution, high-impact medium, it lives up the now-widespread expectation that visual media be crisp clear, displayed on a large screen. Although the appeal of implementing digital signage networks does in part, from plummeting screen prices and sophisticated content delivery what’s equally or more important is that digital signage provides valuable information to the people who need it, when where they need it. On school campuses—whether elementary, high school or post-secondary does so effectively, for both educational purposes and for the security and of and the student body as a whole. School campuses begun digital signage technology in addition to, or in place of, printed material, such as course schedules, content and location; time-sensitive school and updates; maps and directions; welcome messages for visitors and and event schedules. Digital signage creation and delivery of multiple channels of targeted content to different displays on the network. Although a display in college admissions office might provide prospective students with a glimpse into student life, for example, another display outside lab or seminar room might the courses or lectures scheduled for that space throughout the day. This of distribution concept illustrates a school distributing educational content over a public TV broadcast network. At K-12 level, digital signage makes it to deliver information such as team or band practice schedules, or to post the cafeteria menu and give students information encouraging sound food choices. Digital signage in the preschool and daycare setting makes easy for teachers and caregivers to targeted educational programming with their classes. Among the most striking benefits of communicating through digital signage is the quality of the pictures and the flexibility which images, and video can be combined in or more to convey information. Studies have shown that signage is noticed significantly more are and, furthermore, that viewers more likely to remember that dynamic content. Though most regularly updated digital signage content to be text-based, digital networks also have capacity to enable the live campus-wide broadcast of key events: a speech a visiting dignitary, the basketball team’s first trip to the state or national tournament, or even the proceedings at commencement and graduation. When time is short, impractical to the entire student body in one place or there isn’t the time or means to deliver live message other way. The ability to share critical information to entire community, clearly and without has made digital signage valuable as a tool for emergency response and communications. Parents, administrators, teachers students today can’t help but be concerned about the school’s to respond quickly effectively to a dangerous situation, whether the threat be from another person, an environmental hazard, an unpredictable weather system or some other signage installed across a school campus can be updated immediately to students and staff of the danger, and to provide unambiguous instructions for seeking shelter or safety: where to go and what to do. Although early digital signage systems on IP-based networks and point-to-point connections between a player and display, current solutions operate far less and much more scalable platforms. Broadcast-based digital signage models allow content be distributed remotely from single data source via transport media, such as television broadcast, satellite, broadband and WiMAX. T",

Stanley Williams's device. Because behave functionally like synapses, replacing a few transistors in a circuit with memristors could lead to analog circuits that can think like a human brain. It’s time shrinking. Moore’s Law, the semiconductor industry’s obsession with the shrinking of and commensurate steady doubling on a chip about every two years, has been the source of a 50-year technical and economic revolution. Whether this scaling paradigm lasts for five more years or 15, it will eventually come an end. The emphasis in electronics will have to shift to devices that are just increasingly infinitesimal but increasingly capable. Earlier this year, I and my colleagues at Hewlett-Packard Labs, in Palo Alto, Calif., surprised with a fascinating candidate for such a device: the memristor. It had been theorized nearly 40 years but because no one had to build it had long since become an esoteric curiosity. That all changed 1 May, when my group published the details of the memristor in Nature. Combined with transistors in hybrid chip, memristors could radically improve the performance of digital circuits without shrinking transistors. Using transistors more efficiently could in turn give us another decade, at least, of Moore’s Law performance improvement, requiring the costly and increasingly difficult doublings of transistor density on In the end, memristors might even the cornerstone of new analog circuits that compute using an much that of the brain. For nearly 150 years, the known fundamental passive circuit elements were limited to the capacitor (discovered in 1745), the resistor (1827), and the inductor (1831). Then, in a brilliant but underappreciated 1971 paper, Leon Chua, a of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted existence of fourth fundamental device, which he called a memristor. proved that memristor behavior could not be by any circuit built using only the other elements, which is the memristor is truly fundamental. Memristor is a contraction of ”memory resistor,” because that is exactly its function: to remember its history. A memristor is a two-terminal device whose resistance depends on the magnitude and polarity of the voltage applied to it and the length of time that voltage has been applied. When turn off the voltage, memristor remembers its most recent resistance until the next you turn it on, that happens a day later or a year later. Think of a resistor as a pipe through which water flows. The water is electric charge. The resistor’s obstruction of the flow of charge is comparable to the diameter of the pipe: the narrower the pipe, the greater the resistance. For the history of circuit design, resistors have had fixed pipe diameter. But a is a that changes diameter with the amount and direction of water that flows through it. If water flows through this pipe in one direction, it expands (becoming less resistive). send the water in the opposite direction and the pipe shrinks (becoming more resistive). Further, the memristor remembers its diameter water last went through. Turn off the flow and diameter of pipe ”freezes” the water is turned back That freezing property memristors brilliantly for computer memory. The to indefinitely store resistance values means that a memristor can be used as a That might not sound like very much, but go ahead and pop the battery out of laptop, right now—no saving, no nothing. You’d lose your work, of course. But if your laptop were built using a memory based on memristors, when you popped the battery in, your screen would return to life with everything exactly as you left it: no reboot, no half-dozen files. But the memristor’s potential goes beyond instant-on computers to one of the grandest technology challenges: mimicking the functions of a brain. Within a decade, memristors could let us emulate, instead of merely simulate, networks of neurons and synapses. Many research groups have been working a brain in silico: IBM’s Blue Brain project, Hughes Institute’s Janelia Farm, and Harvard’s for Brain Science are just three. even a mouse brain simulation in real time involves solving an astronomical number of coupled partial differential equations.

It looks like a fairly bright star. It's so low the sky, though, that you need a clear horizon to spot it, and binoculars wouldn't hurt. Mercury is a bit of a puzzle. It has a big core that's made mainly of iron, so it's quite dense. Because Mercury so small, the core long ago should've cooled enough to a solid ball. Yet the planet generates a weak magnetic field, hinting that the core is still at least partially molten. The solution to this puzzle may involve an iron \"snow\" deep within the core. The iron in the core probably mixed with sulfur, which has a lower melting than iron. Recent suggest that the sulfur may have the outer part of the core from solidifying -- still a hot, thick liquid. As this mixture cools, though, the iron before the sulfur does. Small bits of solid iron fall toward the center of the planet. This creates convection currents -- like a pot of boiling water. is enough to create a \"dynamo\" effect. Like a generator, it produces currents, which turn create a magnetic field around the planet.

Using recently declassified documents, secondary materials, and interviews with several key participants, the authors weave a story of intra-agency conflict, that undermined intelligence-gathering, affected internal postmortems after the crisis peaked, and resulted keeping Congress the public in the dark about what really happened. We asked Barrett, a professor of political science Villanova University, to discuss the actual series of and what might have happened had the CIA not Soviet missiles on The Actual Sequence of Events . . . “Some months after the Cuban Missile an angry member of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives criticized leaders of the Kennedy administration for let go by in September and early October without construction missile sites in Cuba. It an intelligence failure as serious as the U.S. ignorance that preceded Japanese attack on Pearl in 1941, he said. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara aggressively denied that there had been an American intelligence failure or ineptitude with regard to Cuba in late summer McNamara and others persuaded most observers the administration’s performance in lead-up to the Crisis had almost flawless, but the legislator was right: The CIA had a U-2 spy aircraft over western Cuba about six week There were varying reasons for this, but most was that the Kennedy administration did not wish have a U-2 “incident.” Sending that aircraft over Cuba raised possibility that Soviet surface-to-air missiles might shoot one down. Since was arguably against international law for the U.S. to send spy aircrafts over another country, should one be shot down, there would probably be the same sort of uproar happened in May 1960, Soviet Union shot down an American U-2 flying over its territory. Furthermore, most State Department and CIA authorities not believe USSR would nuclear-armed missiles into that could U.S. Therefore, the CIA told, in effect, not even to request permission to send over western This, at a time when there were growing numbers of reports from and other sources suspicious Soviet equipment being brought into the country.As we now know, the Soviets constructing missile sites on what CIA deputy director Richard would business end of i.e., the western end, in the summer/autumn of 1962.

It grew out of ragtime, which many sources claim is the American music. jazz, ragtime Southern roots, but was also flavored by the southern Midwest. was popular from the late 1800s to around 1920. It developed in African American a mix of march music composers as John Philip Sousa), black and dances including the cakewalk.

However, enjoyed major success in ragtime's early Scott Joplin's 1899 “Maple Leaf Rag” was a hit, as was his “The Entertainer,” which was resurrected a Top 5 it was in the 1974 movie “The Sting” starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman. Born of ragtime, jazz was also heavily influenced by the blues. Blues originated in the late 1800s, but in the deep South. It is an amalgam spirituals, work songs, shouts, chants narrative lyrics. Fused with blues Like jazz, the blues in many forms: delta, piedmont, jump Chicago popularity grew after World II when electric guitars — rather than guitars became popular. By the early 1970s, blues had formed another hybrid: blues While is jangly and the blues takes after its name: blue, or melancholy. Its name is traced to 1912 when Hart Ward copyrighted song, “Dallas — as mix of ragtime and blues — has fused into many styles since its In the 1910s, New Orleans jazz was the first to take off.

(American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, p. 674) Sites of hair pulling can include any area the body in which hair is found, the most common sites are the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, and the pubis area. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) disorder itself is categorized in the DSM-IV-TR as an “Impulse Control Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified” along with like Pathological Gambling, Pyromania, Kleptomania, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Although TM was previously considered to be a rare disorder, more recent research indicates that prevalence rates of may be as high as 2% of the general population. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) prevalence rate is significantly higher than the lifetime prevalence rate of .6% that is cited as a baseline among college students the DSM-IV-TR.

Like every disorder in the DSM-IV-TR, the disturbance must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning. (4th ed., text DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. Alopecia is a key concept that must be understood in order to complete the differential diagnosis of TM. Alopecia is a condition of baldness in most general sense. (Shiel, Jr. & Stoppler, 2008, p. 14) Other medically related causes alopecia should considered in the differential diagnosis especially when working with an individual who deny pulling their hair. The common suspects include male-pattern baldness, (DLE), Lichen (also known as Acuminatus), Folliculitis Decalvans, Pseudopelade of Brocq, and Alopecia (Follicular ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, 676) Comprehensive coverage of these medical conditions is beyond scope of this article – all of the aforementioned confounding variables can be eliminated by general There are a number of idiosyncratic features associated with TM bear mentioning. Although the of features here is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis in isolation, can aid in the differential diagnosis process. Alopecia, regardless the cause, has been known lead sufferers tremendous feats of avoidance so that the loss remains undetected. Simply avoiding social functions or events where the individual (and their attendant hair loss) might be uncovered is a common occurrence. In cases individual’s focus of attention on the head or scalp, it is not uncommon for affected individuals to attempt to hide loss by adopting complimentary hair or headwear (e.g., hats, wigs, etc). These avoidance will be the target of exposure and prevention later in this article. In addition to avoidant behavior and elaborate attempts to “cover it up,” individuals with TM frequently present with significant difficulty in such as self-esteem and Comorbidity, or the of one or more disorders the addition to primary diagnosis, is the rule not the in the stereotypical presentation of TM. Mood disorders depression) are the common (65%) – anxiety (57%), chemical use (22%), and eating disorders (20%) round out the top four mostly likely candidates for comorbidity. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) These comorbidity rates are not overly surprising since they parallel prevalence rates across the wider population – perhaps with the notable exception of the high rate of comorbid disorders. We can speculate about the source of – one possible hypothesis is that few people who suffer TM suffer from a persistent cognitive dissonance associated with having happy-go-lucky personality trait which leads them “let the chips fall where they may.” They are individuals prone to impulsivity, but are subdued and the frustration, fear, rage, and associated with the social limitations placed on them by the disorder. (Ingram, 2012, 269) On the topic of personality, surprisingly research suggests that personality disorders do not share significant overlap with TM.

Baby Watch Early Intervention is statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, interagency, multidisciplinary system, which provides early intervention services to infants and toddlers, younger than three years of age, with developmental delay or disability, and their families. Early intervention is the piece of Education. The program is authorized through the Individuals with Disabilities Act Part C, (Early Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities). In 1987, Utah's Governor designated the Department Health as \"Lead Agency\" for the early intervention program. Utah was one of the first states in the nation to fully implement its early intervention program after the approval of the State Legislature. At present, there are 16 early intervention programs more than 2,000 children per month in the It is anticipated that the demand for these services will continually increase. What is an Interagency Coordinating Council (ICC)? The creation of an ICC was established the of federal law P.L. 99-457 in October 1986. Developers of the legislation recognized need for a group outside of the Lead Agency \"advise in the development of such a system. The independent nature of the ICC is feature that gives the group the potential for making a contribution to the development of the system. Another the regulations is the multidisciplinary and multi-constituency representation on the ICC. specifying what of members should be included on the ICC, the legislation enables states to bring together consumer, political, and administrative communities. This merging of a variety communities facilitates the building of bridges between the involved agencies. In addition, the committee has provided a broader vision of the service system based the participation and contributions of relevant providers and consumers. The ICC, a body required by statute to be appointed by each state's Governor, is to be an important in the development of a well-coordinated service system (Federal Interagency Coordinating Council, June, 1989). Each state determines, in conjunction with the Lead Agency, the nature of the roles and tasks it chooses to perform at various policy stages. The ICC is an interagency group whose membership represents the statewide early childhood services community. is comprised of up 25 members. purpose of the ICC is to advise and assist the lead agency in the Division of Community and Family Health Bureau of Children with Special Health Care Needs in the UDOH. Much of the work of the ICC is accomplished in standing committees and ad hoc task force meetings that perform long range study specific issues and appropriate actions. A member of the ICC chairs each committee. What role does the ICC play? functions as a planning body at the systems level and advocates for children to three years of and their families with or at-risk for a developmental disability.

The movie “Lincoln,” which the struggle to pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery, has turned our attention again to Lincoln’s legacy and his relevance amid our nation’s present divisions and growing pains. is some of wit and wisdom of Abraham Lincoln pondering: “As for being president, I feel like the man who was tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail. To the man who asked him how it, he said, ‘If it wasn’t for honor of the thing, I’d rather walk.’” “I desire so to conduct affairs of this that if the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, have lost every friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and friend shall be down inside of “Should my administration prove to be very wicked one, or is more probable, a very one, if you the people are true yourselves and the Constitution, there but little harm I can do, thank God.” “Bad promises are better broken than kept.” “I am not at all concerned that the Lord is our side in this great struggle, for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right; but it is my constant anxiety and prayer that and this nation may be on the Lord’s side.” “I have never had a feeling, politically, that did not spring the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.” “Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, cannot long it.” “As I would be a slave, so I would not be master. This expresses my idea of democracy.” “The probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just.” “The true in determining embrace or reject is not whether it have any evil in it, but whether it have more evil than good. There are few things wholly evil or wholly “Some of our generals complain I impair discipline and subordination in the by my pardons and respites, but makes me rested, after a hard if I can find some good excuse for a man’s life, and I go to bed happy I how joyful the signing of my name will make deserter) and his family.” “I have been driven many times to my by the overwhelming conviction I had nowhere else to go.” In addition, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address second inaugural speech are ever relevant. And you may wish to add your own favorites to these.

The government has urged people to take traveling to affected areas, and it been every effort to prevent SARS from entering Japan. In addition, work is progressing on a system in which medical institutions, national and local and corporations will act together to prevent the spread of SARS in the event of an outbreak in Japan. As a result of these efforts, as of June 9, there have been no confirmed or probable cases SARS in Japan. staff practice using an isolator. (Jiji) Plans Already Developed with Patients On May 1 the government the heads of the relevant ministries and agencies together for a first-ever meeting to SARS in order to what measures should be taken in the event that in Japan is found to be infected with virus. The group decided to on people returning China to at home for 10 which is believed to be the incubation period for the disease. Taking this into consideration, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare made plans for taking action in the event of an outbreak. It decided give local governments the authority to direct people believed likely to be infected, or \"probable patients,\" to hospitalize In the event that a patient refuses, the local governments empowered to forcibly hospitalize the person. Local governments readying themselves to accept patients. According to a survey conducted by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in early May, all of the 47 prefectures had already completed action spelling out what measures would taken in the event of an outbreak. In addition, some 250 medical the country have such preparations as setting up \"negative air-pressure rooms\" to prevent the virus from within the hospital or the Local governments in such places as Kitakyushu City, and Mie Prefecture have been purchasing capsules isolators to be when suspected patients are moved, and they have conducted drills how to use them with volunteers playing the role of patients. In May a foreign traveler who had been Japan was found to be infected with SARS. When was discovered, the government and local authorities quickly implemented measures, as a result which no secondary infections occurred. According to a survey conducted by the Asahi Shimbun, 28 local governments out of the prefectures 13 major cities in Japan, nearly half the total, were rethinking their plans cope with a potential SARS outbreak in light of Fukushima Prefecture decided to check whether visitors from abroad have come from an area to which the World Health Organization recommends postponing travel. It will also make use of the local hotels association to determine the previous whereabouts of such guests.

Public and Private Sectors Taking Action Japanese government is stepping up its efforts to take rapid, nationwide measures prevent SARS Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has revision of the Disease Law, for example. And while local governments are the first line of defense in tracking the of infection and following up on people who may have been exposed, the national will become directly in the event that infection outside a local area.

Born in 1914, Lipa's early years were affected by political and military events taking place Russia. Latvia had been under Russian imperial rule since the 18th century so World War I meant that there were evacuations from Riga. The Russian Revolution which began in October 1917 between the Red Army and the Army and for the next couple of years various parts of Russia came first under the control of one faction then of the other. Lipa's family went to Petrograd, name that St Petersburg had been given in 1914 when there was strong anti-German feeling Russia, but Lipa was too young to understand the difficulties that his parents went through at this time. At end of World War I 1918, Latvia regained its independence although was to be short-lived. Lipa spent some time back in Riga, but he also spent time in Berlin. His mother took him to Berlin while she was training at the Psychoanalytic During his schooling mathematics became his favourite subject and he decided that it was the subject he wanted to study at university. He studied at University of Zurich, then returned to and studied at university there. At this time Europe was a place of extreme politics and, in Latvia became ruled by a dictator. Lipa was a activist, a democrat who argued strongly for human rights. He was at this time a soap-box orator putting his views across strongly both in and in writing for underground newspaper. Strongly opposed to dictators and strongly advocating democracy it was that his criticism of Latvian dictator could not be ignored by the authorities. A was issued for his arrest and, just in time, he escaped to Prague. His girl friend Mary Kagan followed him to Prague where they married 15 May 1938. There were a number of reasons why Bers chose to to Prague this time. Firstly he had to escape from secondly Prague was in a democratic country, and thirdly aunt lived so he could permission to study at the Charles University without having to find a job to support himself. One should not underestimate fact that by this stage his mathematical preferences were very much in place and Karl Loewner Prague looked the ideal supervisor. Indeed Bers did obtain his doctorate which was awarded in 1938 from the Charles University of Prague where he thesis on potential theory under Karl Loewner's supervision. At the time Bers was rather unhappy with Loewner :- Lipa spoke of feeling neglected, perhaps even not encouraged, by Loewner and said that only retrospect did he understand Loewner's teaching method. He to each of his students the amount support needed ... It is obvious that Lipa did not appear too needy to Loewner. In 1938 became an impossible country someone background. Equally dangerous was the fact that Bers homeland since he was a wanted man in Latvia, and was a left wing academic. With little choice but escape again, Bers fled to Paris where his daughter was born. However, the war followed him and soon the Nazi began France. Bers applied for a visa to the USA and, while waiting to permission, he wrote two papers on Green's functions and integral Just days before Paris surrendered to the advancing armies, and family moved from Paris to a part of France not yet attack advancing German armies. last he received the news that he was waiting for, the issue of American visas for his family. 1940 Bers and his family arrived in the United States and joined his mother who was already in New York. There was of course a flood of well academics arriving in the United States fleeing from Nazis and there was a great scarcity of posts, even for the most brilliant, so he was unemployed until 1942, living with other unemployed refugees in New York. During this time he continued his mathematical researches. After this he was appointed Research Instructor at Brown University where, as part work relevant to the war effort, he studied subsonic fluid This was important at that time since aircraft wings were being designed for with engines capable of high speeds. 1945 1949 at Syracuse University, first at Assistant Professor, later as Associate Professor.

Now volume of the ice varies throughout the rising to its peak after midwinter, and falling to its minimum after midsummer, usually in the month of September. Over most of the last 1,400 years, the volume of ice remaining each September has pretty But since 1980, we have lost 80 per cent of that ice. Now one thing to appreciate is that over the last 4.7 billion years, there have been many natural cycles in the climate — both heating and cooling. What's happening today in the Arctic is not cycle caused by nature, but something that we humans did by burning fossil fuels and dumping slightly over trillion tonnes of into the atmosphere over the century. So what are these natural cycles? There are many many of them, but let's just look at the Milankovitch cycles. These cycles relate to the and its orbit around the Sun. There are three main Milankovitch cycles. They each affect how much solar radiation lands on Earth, and whether ice, land or water, and when it lands. The Milankovitch the orbit the Earth changes from mostly circular elliptical. It does a predominantly 100,000-year cycle. When the Earth is close the Sun receives more energy, and when it further away it gets less. At the moment the orbit of the halfway between \"nearly circular\" and elliptical\". So the change in the distance to the Sun in each calendar year is currently about 5.1 million kilometres, which to about 6.8 per cent difference in incoming solar radiation. But when the orbit of the Earth is at its most elliptical, there will be a 23 per cent in how much solar radiation lands on the The second Milankovitch cycle affecting the solar radiation landing on our planet the of the north-south spin axis compared to the plane of the of the around the This rocks gently between 22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees from the vertical. This cycle has a of about years. the moment we are roughly halfway in the — we're about 23.44 degrees from the vertical and heading down to As we head to the year 11,800, the trend is that the summers in each hemisphere will get less solar radiation, while the winters will get more, there will be a slight overall The third Milankovitch cycle that affects how much solar radiation lands on our planet is a little tricky to understand. It's called 'precession'. As our orbits the Sun, the spin axis does more than just rock gently between degrees and 24.5 degrees. It also — just like a giant spinning — sweeps out a complete 360 degrees and it takes about 26,000 years to do this. So on January 4, the Earth is at its closest to the Sun, it's the South Pole (yep, the that points towards the Sun. So moment, everything else being equal, it's the southern hemisphere that has a warmer summer because it's getting more radiation, but six months later it will have a colder winter. And the northern hemisphere will have a warmer winter and a cooler summer. But of \"everything else\" is not equal. There's more land in the northern but ocean in a southern hemisphere. The Arctic is that is floating on water and surrounded by land. The Antarctic is the opposite — ice that is sitting on land and surrounded by You begin to see how complicated it all is.

The discovery by Dr Nicholas and Professor Alister Graham, Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology, found smaller galaxies have far smaller holes than previously estimated. Central black holes, millions to billions of times more massive than the Sun, reside in the core of most galaxies, and are thought to be integral to formation and evolution. astronomers are still trying to understand this relationship. and Graham combined data from observatories in Chile, Hawaii and the Hubble Telescope, to develop a data base listing the masses of 77 galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. The astronomers mass of each central black hole by measuring how fast stars are Existing theories suggest direct ratio between the mass of a galaxy and that of its black hole. \"This ratio worked for larger galaxies, but with improved technology we're now able to examine far smaller galaxies and current theories don't hold up,\" says Scott. In a paper to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, they found that for each ten-fold decrease in galaxy's mass, there was a one hundred-fold decrease in its central black mass. \"That was a surprising result which we been anticipating,\" says The study found that smaller galaxies have far denser stellar populations near centres than larger galaxies. According to Scott, this also means the central black holes in smaller grow much faster than their larger counterparts. Black holes grow by merging with other black when their galaxies collide. \"When large galaxies merge they double in size and so do their central black holes,\" says Scott. \"But when small galaxies merge their central black quadruple in size because of the greater densities of nearby stars to feed on.\" Somewhere in between The findings also solve the long standing problem of missing intermediate mass black holes. For decades, scientists have been searching something in between stellar mass holes formed when largest stars die, and supermassive black holes at the of galaxies. \"If the central black holes in smaller galaxies have lower mass than originally thought, they may represent the intermediate mass hole population astronomers have been for,\" says Graham. \"Intermediate sized black holes are between ten thousand and a few hundred thousand times the mass of the Sun, and we we've found several good candidates.\" \"These may be big enough to be seen directly by generation extremely large telescopes now being built,\" says Graham.",

Their findings are in the of Seismological Society of America. \"Although we can't put a precise on because of their erosion characteristics, we can use them to provide physical limits on the level ground shaking that could potentially have occurred in area,\" Anooshehpoor. The researchers developed a three-dimensional model of each hoodoo and determined the most likely place where each spire would fail in an earthquake. They then tested rock samples similar to the hoodoo pillars to measure their tensile strength and compared their results with previously published data. USGS records suggest at least one large magnitude earthquake along the in the last 550 years, resulting seven metres of slip, yet hoodoos are still standing. This finding is consistent with a median of ground motion associated with the large quakes in this region, says Anooshehpoor. \"If an earthquake occurred with a higher level of motion, the hoodoos would have collapsed,\" he says. \"Nobody can predict earthquakes, but will predict what ground motions associated with earthquakes they happen.\" Dr Juan Carlos Afonso from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Sydney's Macquarie University says it's an exciting development. \"In it's not just difficult to the entire planet, it's hard to cover even active near populated areas,\" says Afonso. need lots of instruments, so it's great if you on natural objects to help you.\" He while the work is still very new and needs to be the physics seems sound.",

What was not appreciated at the time by the Allied high command just how desperately short of vital the Third Reich armies actually were. Ardennes Offensive was Hitler's bold attempt to capture and hold the Allied army's massive supply of Brussels sprouts, vital - of course - for the full functioning of any army. German intelligence were that the American army was - in particular - massing huge quantities of the vital Brussels sprouts just behind their in preparedness for their own massive push - and - of course - time Christmas. German's plan would have succeeded the had not quickly worked out that it was their stockpiles of sprouts that were under immediate threat. The bold plan put forward by the Allied Generals was a heavy gamble, but paid off. They ordered their front-line to begin boiling their stocks of Brussels sprouts, and - most importantly - to keep them boiling past a state fully preparedness. So, when the weather altered and wind direction changed, it blew the smell of over-cooked Brussels sprouts straight into the faces of the advancing Germans. Then the Reich troops knew that they would not be able to replenish their stocks of Brussels sprouts and any sprouts that they did from the Allied frontline kitchens would overcooked to the point of inedibility. Later in this series, we will discuss the major strategic role that Brussels sprouts have played in world history, such Hadrian building a wall to protect the Roman Empire's most northern supplies of Brussels sprouts from the northern barbarians, thwarting the barbarian's fiendish plan deep-fry the Roman's entire stockpiles of sprouts. Then there was, also, Napoleon's retreat from Moscow when his over-long supply line of Brussels sprouts direct from France broke down. Even when his troops get sprouts, they were of poor quality - dry, wizened and frozen solid. Of course, this led to a massive collapse of morale. Eventually, the lack of good quality forced a massive retreat where thousands of French troops died from a pitiful lack of sprouts. And, of course, not forgetting - of course - how the Spanish conquest of the Americas was a result of the Spaniards overwhelming sprout superiority.",

One day mother, having made some said to her: \"Go, my dear, see how thy does, for I hear she has been ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter.\" Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village. As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer who had a very great mind to her up, but he dared not, because of some hard by the forest. asked her whither she was going. The poor who did not know that it was dangerous and hear a wolf talk, to him: \"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a pot of butter my mamma.\" \"Does she live far said the Wolf. \"Oh! aye,\" answered Little Red Riding-Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house the village.\" \"Well,\" said the \"and I'll go and see too.

He then shut the door and went into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterward and knocked at the door—tap, tap. Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing big voice of the was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse, \"’Tis your grandchild, Little Riding-Hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you.\" The Wolf cried out her, softening voice as much as he could: \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch go Red Riding-Hood pulled the and the door opened.

To begin, a liquefied material – in this a paste – is through a needle-like tip by applying air pressure. The needle moves in all three dimensions which means it is able to create a three dimensional object. The printer is called ‘Bioplotter’ the unique aspect of this machine is its use of biomaterials to implants or other objects for biomedical application. Some the implants are made using the 3D Bioplotter are intended to dissolve in the body.

But according to Dr. Tali Hatuka, head of Tel Aviv University's for Contemporary Urban Design (LCUD) at the Department of and the Human Environment, these cities are a poor fit for modern lifestyles and it's time to innovate. TAU has launched a project, in collaboration with a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Prof. Eran Ben-Joseph, to revitalize aging Last month, a team of five TAU and MIT graduate students visited Kiryat Gat, a mid-sized town the south of Israel.

Planning a future for the mid-sized city The project, jointly funded by Vice for Research and MIT's MISTI Global Funds, will create a new planning model that could reshape the future of Kiryat Gat and similar cities across the world which are often overlooked in academia and practical planning. \"Our goal to a spotlight on these kinds of towns and suggest innovative ways of dealing with their problems,\" says TAU student Roni Bar. MIT's Alice Shay, who visited Israel for the first time for the project, believes that Kiryat Gat, a city that massive urbanization has left behind, is ideal place for the to make a change. \"The city is at a catalyst point — an exciting moment where good governance and energy will it the capacity to implement some these new projects.\" To tackle the design and planning challenges of the city, team students focused on four themes: the \"mobile city,\" which looked at and accessibility; the \"mediated city,\" dealing with technological the \"compact city,\" which reconsidered the use urban space and population growth; and the city,\" which integrated environmental features into the urban landscape. common ground Ultimately, the team’s goal is to create a flexible city that encourages and workers be a more part of urban of the city, said Dr. Hatuka.

The title will deceiving, it has nothing to with recent sacred-vs.-secular Christmas quarrels. Nissenbaum explores the myriad ways that Christmas has evolved in our nation. It turns out we've been jockeying for than 300 years over what this holiday means. In America our faith-filled ancestors banned Christmas altogether, outlawing it in some colonies. Until the 1760s, one could not even find an almanac that would print the word \"Christmas\" on date Dec. 25. This opposition was because Christmas had become a drunken spectacle where gangs of poor young men roamed the streets, making merry and engaging in acts of petty rowdyism, vaguely like today's New Year's It was customary permissible for these gangs to on doors of strangers to demand gifts. (\"So give us some figgy pudding....\") Our nation's first \"battle\" for Christmas was movement to domesticate the holiday, a battle that suggests involved merchants, the middle and upper classes and the church. Merchants began linking Christmas and the purchase of manufactured gifts as early as the 1830s society began to stress family celebrations in front of a tree and with Santa visiting every home. In case you think that your complaining will the commercialism of this holiday, according to Nissenbaum that complaint first emerged the 1830s. Complain if you must, but don't expect results. so thoroughly explores \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\" that one learns why Saint Nick touches the side of his nose and why his pipe is a short one. contends that the ascendance of Santa Claus, the emergence of Christmas tree and even the giving of gifts contribute to this gradual process of making Christmas a less revolutionary, more predictable holiday. He explores Dickens and Scrooge, Christmas parties for poor children and even the complicated master-slave relationship at Christmas up to and immediately following the Civil War. If you to maintain that Christmas was a pure season of private devotion and public worship Sears, Roebuck, Wal-Mart and the Supreme Court got don't read book. Ditto if you enjoy that \"They've taken Christmas away from us,\" Nissenbaum might say a pure, simple never existed. Rather it has evolved since the first day the Colonists set foot on our shore, an evolution showing no sign of abating. Nissenbaum's scholarly, heavily footnoted book is enlightening and readable. But his analysis of Christmas reminds me of a scientist who thoroughly explains the rainbow never grasps its beauty.

A clinical is a biomedical/health-related study into the effects on humans of a new medical treatment (medicine/drug, medical device, vaccine new therapy), sometimes called an investigational medicinal product (IMP). Before a new drug is authorised and can be marketed, it must through several phases of development including trial in which its safety, efficacy, risks, optimal use and/or benefits are on human beings. Existing drugs must also undergo testing before can be used to treat other conditions than that for which they were originally intended. Organisations conducting clinical in the European Union must, they wish to obtain marketing authorisation, respect the requirements for the of clinical trials. These can be found in Clinical Trials Directive (“Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of Council of 4 April 2001 on approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials for There are also guidelines ensure that clinical are carried out in accordance with good clinical practice. These are contained the “Commission Directive 2005/28/EC of 8 April 2005 laying down principles and detailed for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, well as the for authorisation of manufacturing or importation of such (also known as the Good Practice or GCP for short). This document provides concrete guidelines and lends further support to the Clinical Trials Directive. The London-based European Agency (EMA) has published additional, specific guidelines which must also be respected. These include guidelines on procedures and requirements related to quality, safety and efficacy. Copies of the above-mentioned documents in 22 languages can be found http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/clinicaltrials/clinicaltrials_en.htm protection of people participating in clinical trials (and in cases other types of research) is further promoted by provisions of: - the European Convention Human Rights and Biomedicine (Oviedo Convention, 2619/1998), - the Additional protocol to the Oviedo Convention Biomedical Research - the Nuremberg Code of 1949, - the revised Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association regarding Ethical for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, - The Belmont Report of 18 April on Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research. are the different phases of trials? an experimental drug or medical procedure usually an extremely lengthy process, sometimes lasting several years. The overall procedure divided into a series of stages (known as phases) which are described below. Clinical testing on can only begin after a pre-clinical phase, involving studies (in vitro) and tests on animals, which shown that the experimental drug is considered safe and effective. Whilst a amount of testing can be carried out by means of computer modelling and by isolating cells it becomes necessary at some point in time to test the drug on a living creature. Animal testing is an obligatory stage in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for new drugs and medicines, hence a legal requirement (EU Directive 2001/83/EC relating to Products for Human Use). The necessity of out prior testing on animals is also stated in the World Association’s “Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. In order to protect the well-being of animals, researchers are guided by three principles which are called the 3Rs: Reduce the number of animals used to a minimum Refine way that experiments carried out so that the effect on the animal is minimised and animal welfare is improved Replace animal experiments with alternative techniques wherever possible. In addition, most will have official bodies which control animal research. Most animals research are mice. However, no animal is sufficiently similar (even genetically modified to make human testing unnecessary. For this reason, experimental must also be tested on humans. The main phases of clinical trials trials humans can be into three main phases (literally, phase I, II and III). phase has specific objectives (please see below) and number of people involved increases as the trial progresses from one phase to the next.

Alzheimer Europe would like to recall some general which guide present response: - Having a gene associated with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia does not mean that a person has the disease. - People who have a gene linked to Alzheimer's disease or form of have the rights as anyone - Genetic testing not only affect the person taking the test. It may also reveal information about relatives who might not want to know. No genetic test 100% accurate. - The extent to which health cover is provided to citizens by the State social security system and/or privately by individuals differs from one country to the next. the of these principles, Europe has developed following position with regard to genetic testing: - Alzheimer Europe firmly believes that the use and/or possession of genetic information insurance companies should be prohibited. - Alzheimer Europe supports research into genetic factors linked to dementia which might our understanding of cause and development the disease and possibly contribute to future treatment. - on its current information, Alzheimer does not encourage the use of any genetic test for dementia UNLESS such has a high and proven success rate either in assessing the risk of the disease (or not as the case may be) or in detecting the existence of it in a particular individual. - Europe requests further information on the accuracy, reliability and predictive value of any genetic dementia. - Genetic testing should be accompanied by adequate pre- and post-test counselling. - Anonymous testing should be possible so that ensure that such information does not in their medical files against their will. It is extremely important for people dementia to be diagnosed as soon as possible. In the Alzheimer’s disease, an early diagnosis may enable the person concerned to benefit from medication, which treats the global symptoms of the disease and is most effective in the early to mid stages of the disease. Most forms of dementia involve deterioration of faculties (e.g. memory, language and thinking etc.) but in the early stages, it still possible for the person affected to make decisions finances and care etc. – hence the of an early diagnosis. If it were to detect dementia before the symptoms became obvious, this would give people a greater opportunity to make informed decisions about their lives. This is one of the potential benefits of genetic testing. On the other hand, such information could clearly be used in ways which would be contrary to their personal interests, perhaps resulting in employment discrimination, loss of opportunities, stigmatisation, health insurance costs or even loss of health to name but a examples. The present discussion paper some of the recommendations of Alzheimer and its member organisations and raises few points which deserve clarification and The necessity for a response by Alzheimer Europe In the last few years, the issue of genetic testing has been increasingly debated. In certain European there are already companies offering such tests.

The nickname God particle is ironic for two reasons. First, generally, the nuclear physicists who deal with these matters - postulating the fundamental physical laws of the universe and then setting about to either verify or refute them - tend not to regular church-goers. While there are some highly prominent who balance personal, beliefs with professional, scientific quests, most probably go along the thoughts of the world-famous physicist, Stephen Hawking: I regard the as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. [Interview in 7/9/12] Spontaneous creation is the there is something rather nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not to invoke God... [from his book; The Grand Design, 2010] So is a bit ironic that physics' famous quest has resulted in discovery of the 'God particle.' physicists are quite comfortable having their names associated with famous - even if dead - like Newton, Einstein the afore-mentioned Hawking. One will find few, if any, attributions to deities objects that physicists discover and name or the theories they propose. Second, and more importantly, the discovery that the really does - as the name suggests - imply that God played some role in creation the universe. In fact, quite the opposite. The matter is discussed at some length in the July 9 Daily Beast by Lawrence Kraus, well-known from Arizona State University: This term [God appeared first in the unfortunate of a book written by physicist Leon Lederman two decades ago, and while to my knowledge it never used by any scientist (including Lederman) before or it has captured the media's imagination. What makes this term unfortunate is that nothing could be further from the truth. Assuming the particle in is indeed the Higgs, it validates an unprecedented revolution in our of fundamental physics and brings science closer to dispensing with need for any supernatural all the way back to the beginning of the universe...If these bold, some say arrogant, derive support from the remarkable results at the Large Hadron Collider, they may reinforce two potentially uncomfortable that many features of our universe, our existence, may be accidental consequences of conditions associated with the birth; and second, that creating from \"no stuff\" seems to be no problem at all-everything we see could have emerged a purposeless quantum burp in space or perhaps a quantum burp of space itself. Humans, with their remarkable tools and their remarkable brains, may have just taken a giant step toward replacing metaphysical speculation with empirically verifiable knowledge. The Higgs particle is now arguably more relevant than God. So the term God was first used by a scientist, but was picked up and popularized the media.

This will save dollars in tooling costs and help assure that the correct process to achieve the requirements is chosen. All too often, the plastic molds are manufactured, the first parts assembled, and then quality determines that the parts will not pass test. This is too late; now significant dollars will need to spent to Requirements such as a need for pressurization, exposure to extreme or heat, cosmetic-part status (requires no blemishes), and parts assembled per minute all factors in determining the and plastic Each process has unique plastic-joint design to proper weld Assembly suppliers can help design the weld area joint design. An example of joint design requirements for assembly is given by to Ultrasonics from Dukane Charles, IL, U.S.): \"Mating services should be intimate contact around the entire joint. The joint should be in one plane, if possible. A small initial contact should be established between mating halves. A means of alignment recommended so that mating halves do not misalign during the weld operation.\" Obviously, these joint requirements should all be designed into the part to injection molds. What assembly process is for part? As stated earlier, ultrasonic, hot-plate, spin, thermal, vibration, and laser welding are the most common methods used in production today. Each method has unique advantages. Ultrasonic assembly is a repeatable, and reliable process that allows for sophisticated process control. High-volume small parts that have very tight tolerances lend themselves well ultrasonic assembly. Ultrasonic systems have the capability exporting relevant assembly process data for SPC documentation and FDA validation. Ultrasonic welding can be easily integrated into automated systems. Hot-plate welding can accommodate a wide range of parts and configurations. These machines offer high-reliability hermetic seals and strong mechanical bonds on complex part geometries. The process is fairly simple; two parts jointed are brought in close proximity to the joint area is in a molten state. platen is and the parts are clamped together until the joint cools off and to a solid state. Spin welding is a cost-effective method for joining large, medium, or small circular parts such as washing machine tubs to agitator components. Water purification filters, thermal mugs, and irrigation assemblies typically are joined using spin welding Careful attention to joint design is critical that require flash-free Assemblies that require inserts at points on planes, like computer or vacuum cleaner housings, typically benefit from thermal insertion/staking. Thermal staking is ideal for attachment of non-plastic components to the plastic housing, such as circuit boards and metal brackets. Dates coding, embossing, and degating are other uses for thermal presses. Thermal welding can be a slower assembly process than ultrasonic, so, depending on the volumes of assemblies required, ultrasonic maybe choice. Vibration welding physically moves one of the two parts horizontally under pressure create heat through surface friction. Compared to ultrasonic welding, vibration welding operates at much lower much higher amplitude, and with greater clamping force. The limitation to vibration welding is simply that the joint must be in a single plane in at least one axis in order to allow the vibration Like hot-plate welding, vibration welding a highly reliable process can handle large parts challenging materials or parts per cycle with",

Produce and leafy greens in the photo are (clockwise from top): lettuce, cabbage, cilantro in a bed of broccoli sprouts, spinach and other leafy greens, green onions, tomatoes, and leaf lettuce. If pathogens like E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella had a for survival, it might “Find! Bind! Multiply!” That pretty much sums up what these bacteria do in nature, moving through our environment to find a host they bind to and use a staging area for multiplying and spreading. But ARS food-safety scientists in California are to find out how to stop these and other foodborne pathogenic bacteria in their tracks, before microbes can make their leafy greens and favorite salad ingredients like tomatoes and sprouts. The research is needed to help prevent the pathogens from turning up in fresh produce that we typically eat uncooked. That’s Robert E. Mandrell, who leads the ARS Produce Safety and Microbiology Research Unit. His team is based at the agency’s Western Regional Research Center in California. The team is pulling apart the lives of these microbes to uncover the secrets their It’s a complex challenge, part because the microbes seem to effortlessly switch from one persona to the next. They are perhaps best known as residents of the intestines of warm-blooded animals, including humans. For role, the pathogens to find, bind, and multiply in the world of green plants. Sometimes the pathogenic microbes need the of other species to make the jump from animal inhabitant to plant little known about these powerful partnerships, Mandrell says. That’s why alliances microbes are one of several of pathogens’ lifestyles that the Albany scientists are investigating. In all, knowledge gleaned from these and other laboratory, greenhouse, and outdoor studies should lead to new, effective, environmentally friendly ways to thwart the pathogens before they have a chance to make us ill. In greenhouse, microbiologist Maria Brandl examines cilantro that she uses as a model plant to investigate the behavior of foodborne pathogens on leaf surfaces. A Pathogen Targets Youngest Knowing pathogens’ preferences is essential to any well-planned counter-attack. So microbiologist Maria T. Brandl is scrutinizing the little-understood ability of E. O157:H7 and Salmonella contaminate the elongated, slightly sweet leaves romaine lettuce. With a University California-Berkeley colleague, Brandl has shown if given a choice, E. coli has a strong preference for the young, inner leaves. researchers exposed romaine lettuce leaves E. coli and that the microbe multiplied about 10 times more on the young leaves than on the older, middle ones. One explanation: The young leaves are a nutrition “buy” for E. coli. “These leaves exude about three times more and about one-and-one-half times more carbon than do the leaves,” says Brandl. Scientists have for decades that plants exude compounds from their leaves and roots that bacteria and fungi can use as food. But the romaine lettuce study, published earlier this year in Environmental Microbiology, is the first to document the different exudate among leaves of the two age classes. It’s also the first to show E. coli can do more than just bind to lettuce leaves: It can multiply and spread on them. Research assistant Danielle Goudeau inoculates a lettuce leaf E. coli O157:H7 in a biological safety cabinet to study the biology of the human pathogen on greens. Adding nitrogen to the middle boosted E. coli growth, Brandl found. “In view the role of in helping E. coli multiply on young leaves,” she says, strategy that minimizes use of nitrogen fertilizer in lettuce fields may worth investigating.” In other studies using romaine lettuce and the popular herb cilantro as models, Brandl documented the extent to which E. and are aided by Erwinia chrysanthemi, an that causes fresh produce to rot. “When compared to plant pathogens, E. coli and Salmonella are not as ‘fit’ on plants,” Brandl says. But the presence of the rot-producing microbe E. coli and Salmonella grow on lettuce and cilantro leaves. “Soft rot promoted formation of large called ‘biofilms,’ of E. and Salmonella and increased their numbers by up to 100-fold,” she notes. The study uncovered new about genes that the food-poisoning pathogens kick into action when teamed up with plant pathogens such as soft rot microbes.

Interpretive Summary: Laurel wilt is a lethal vascular disease of trees in the plant family including avocado. It is caused by pathogen (Raffaelea that is introduced into host trees by an exotic wood-boring beetle, the redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus). The beetle was first detected in Georgia in 2002, and since has spread to six states in southeastern U.S. Laurel wilt an imminent to commercial avocado production in south Florida, and a future threat to avocado in California, Mexico, Central and South America. Scientists at the USDA-ARS Horticulture Research Station, in collaboration with the University of Florida, are conducting research on the pest complex, including (1) evaluation of fungicides for laurel wilt, (2) screening for resistant avocado varieties, (3) determination of pathways for disease transmission, (4) identification beetle repellents, and insecticides, and (5) of host preferences. Information from these studies will be used by growers and by and federal action agencies engaged in programs for redbay beetle. Laurel wilt kills members of the plant family, including avocado. The disease has invaded much of southeastern USA, and threatens avocado commerce and homeowner in Florida, valuable in Miami (USDA-ARS), and in California Laurel wilt is caused by a recently Raffaelea lauricola, which is vectored by an invasive ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus. Current topics include: disease management with fungicides; identifying resistance; vector with insecticides and repellents; host ranges of, and the pathogen and and transmission R. lauricola via seed, scion material, root grafts and pruning tools.

Because they are so important to the Karen people, are their friends, and are treated respect. To manage an elephant and gain its requires knowledge, love and understanding. This is why the Karen people look after their elephants so well, and only certain members of the Karen family are trained enough do this. Some of them call elephant-care a kind of black magic, and this black magic is passed down through families. Part of the skill of caring for elephants is to ensure the elephant is listened to. Karen legend has it that if a female elephant is ignored, it is likely eggs will become infected, and therefore she will not be able to the elephant family. This serious consequence acts as a grave warning to those handling elephants. A sense of duty, and patience are important to the elephant as they are to the Karen people as whole.

One day, mother needed to leave for a business, so instructed the two boys to look after the house, be good, and by no means split open bamboo tree, as it contained many flies. Being the mischievous boys they were, as soon as their mother out of sight, they crept up to the forbidden bamboo and cracked it open, curious to see what would Immediately, the was filled flies, two of flew up each of the boys' noses. Panicking, boys didn't know to do. Soon, they their bodies changing. Their legs to itch, and grow longer and wider. Their heads began to swell, until they felt the size and shape of footballs. Their noses grew longer and their bodies became heavier and more When their mother returned home, she was shocked to see what had happened to her She offered them cooked rice, but they turned it down with a slow shake of their large heads, their noses swinging from side to side. They were still growing, and were too ashamed their bad to eat. The mother offered them water, but they did not want to drink it. Soon, the sons grown big for the house, and could now only on four legs, they left the house to find grass. This was all they felt like eating. Very the word spread, and people came from all over the valley to see mutated boys. Their tongues had become big for them to so sons had stopped talking. if to compensate, their ears grew large so they cold hear very They had elephant-boys. One day, some workers came to see if elephant-boys could help them carry heavy loads. They gave them wood and lead them to workshops, and the elephant-boys calm and obedient.

The Seven Years’ War of 1756 – 1763 heightened the trend, and by the end of the Wars field armies had become enormous. Forces of 100,000 or even more, unheard of before, were not at all unusual by 1815. The French army introduced the of a corps d’armee, body of infantry, cavalry and artillery plus essential services. The could fight alone or in cooperation with other corps, and included all necessary combat and administrative elements. By the end of the Napoleonic wears, all participants had organized their troops into corps, usually made of varying numbers of divisions and During years 1815, some nations kept their corps structure in place during peacetime, using them administer recruiting, and other non-combat functions. This would speed mobilization and keep the staffs employed. The and composition of corps also became with each having the same number and types of subordinate By the middle of the 19th century, an army corps had become defined as the number of troops that be deployed from a road in less than two hours: 20,000 men. That rule of thumb had been badly exceeded as extra troops were added: cavalry, engineers, artillerymen, light infantry, medical services, supply columns more. The Prussian corps organization used in the 1866 had been as part of War Minister Albrecht von Roon’s reforms starting 1860. In 1859, the Prussian Army mobilized its four army corps for war on the side of against France.

At division level, things got more complex. The division controlled brigades, plus an artillery detachment of four six-gun These would usually be parceled out to the brigades in action. During peacetime division was responsible for either a pioneer battalion or a light infantry battalion; during wartime these would be held the corps reserve. The corps controlled two infantry divisions, plus attachments of artillery and cavalry. varied from four seven batteries (six guns each) and two to five cavalry regiments.

Ramp workers can do much more without the wire, the shouting or the hand signals. A typical wireless pushback towing uses a portable transceiver for communication among one or more wing walkers and the tractor operator during movement. The tractor operator is free to concentrate on correct and all crew members can warn others instantly impending dangers. To the flow communication and chatter, the system is configured so that all team can hear the pilot, but the tractor operator can directly to the flight deck. Because wireless communication increases coordination and enables verbal warnings, it decreases the risk of accidents, shortens turn-around times, increases the likelihood of hitting flight slots. In addition pushbacks and towing, wireless team communication systems can also used to improve safety and efficiency deicing, cargo and maintenance In a deicing a wireless system connects driver and the basket, and the system itself can be connected to two-way radios enabling communication with remote users. Communication between the driver and the basket takes on open microphone over 1.9GHz (1.8GHz in EU) encrypted frequency while also allowing radio monitoring and transmitting with a push to-talk button on the headsets. Systems can configured to enable multiple crews to communicate while working on the same aircraft - improving efficiency. Additional configurations are available for maintenance teams and are to almost any size. Choosing a Communication System Wireless headset systems are available in a wide variety of configurations and price ranges. To ensure a system meets the diverse needs of ground consider the following factors Is the system truly number of so-called “wireless” systems actually require a wire from the headset to a radio or belt pack. While these systems allow freedom of movement, a belt pack or radio wire creates many of the same problems systems, particularly cords. Moreover, belt packs have less than half the transmission range of self-contained systems on head. Does the system use DECT or Bluetooth technology? Transmission technology can dramatically affect how well systems perform in the field. Systems that employ Bluetooth technology generally have a limited range and are subject to radio frequency interference from nearby devices. Look for systems that use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications technology. DECT units generally offer up to 30 times more coverage and are less to interference than Bluetooth. DECT transmissions also have multipath capability, the signal will bounce up, over and around objects in order to establish the best possible connection. DECT signals are also digitally encoded to ensure privacy. Is the system full-duplex or half-duplex? Half-duplex systems communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time. That’s a walkie-talkie. On the hand, full-duplex systems allow communication in both directions simultaneously. Full-duplex capabilities are an important safety because they allow the parties to speak and others at same time. Is the system radio-compatible? during pushback and towing is generally to the flight deck, wing and tractor operator; however, other ground support functions from the ability to communicate with remote users over two-way radio. Look for a system with radio-interface flexibility.",

Cattle Egrets in their breeding plumage, like the ones in the picture, can be distinguished other white and herons by the patches of light orange-brown on their crests chests. Nonbreeding Cattle Egrets can be all white, and then their relatively thick, yellow beaks and thicker, shorter necks separate them from similar-sized, white herons and egrets found here, as Snowy and juvenile Little Blue I remember the first time Cattle Egrets were spotted in the rural part of western Kentucky where I grew in 1963. Their appearance was so unusual that a farmer not particularly interested called parents and said that a whole flock big white birds had appeared his pasture, and we went up to take look. I in college before I learned that they were Cattle Egrets, BUBULCUS IBIS. My ornithology teacher told how the birds were undergoing one of the fastest and most widely ranging expansions of distribution seen among birds. Originally Egrets were native to southern Spain and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and subtropical Asia. In the late 1800s they began expanding their range into southern Africa, and were first sighted in the on the boundary of and Suriname, in 1877, apparently having flown across the Atlantic Ocean. They didn't get permanently established there until the 1930s, though, but then they began into much of the rest of the Americas, reaching western Kentucky around the early 60s. The species appears still to be expanding northward in western North America, but in Northeast it seems to be in Though they can turn up as far north as southern Canada, coast to coast, mostly they breed in the US Southeast. The Wikipedia says that Cattle Egrets eat and flies from cattle. They do that, but who watches our birds awhile sees that mainly as the cattle move around they stir up creatures in the grass, which the egrets prey on. The cows' fresh manure also attracts flies for BOX TURTLES interesting to see turtles manage it, but for many readers familiar with box turtles in other North America the picture raise the question of why those in our picture bear different colors and patterns than theirs. What's happening is that Box Turtles are represented by six subspecies. Hillary's Gulf Coast location is supposed to be home to the Gulf Coast subspecies, Terrapene carolina ssp. major. However, that subspecies is described as having a brownish top shell, carapace, sometimes with a few spots or but nothing like these bright, yellow lines. I can't say what's going on. Apparently Box Turtle is a RESTING FLY That looks like a mosquito but you can see from how much of the leaf he covers that he's far too large to be any mosquito species found here. Also, he lacks the hypodermic-like proboscis mosquitoes use to suck blood. No mouthparts are visible on our crane fly because crane flies generally hardly eat at all, only occasionally lapping up a bit of pollen or flower nectar. Their maggot-like larvae feed on plant Some species can damage crops. Oosterbroek's monumental, 2012 Catalogue of the Craneflies of the World -- free and online at http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/ccw/ --recognizes 15,345 cranefly of them just in our Nearctic ecozone, which embraces the US, Canada, Greenland, most of Mexico. why when I shipped the picture to volunteer identifier Bea in Ontario it took more time than usual her verdict to come in, and she was comfortable only with calling it the genus Whatever our species, it's a pleasure to take the shown at http://www.backyardnature.net/n/12/120429cg.jpg. are those things below the wings looking like needles with droplets of water their ends? Those are \"halteres,\" which commonly occur among the Order of Insects, the Diptera. Though their purpose isn't known with certainty, it's assumed they help control flight, enabling flies to sudden mid-air changes in direction. From the evolutionary perspective, halteres are modified back wings. Most insects have two pairs, or four, wings, but not the Diptera, as the name implies -- di-ptera, as they \"two-wings\" in Greek.

Males display and vocalize to win their of female. The “pecking order” comes from natural behavior. Dominant behavior is natural expected in the wild. We must be as humans, to project our sense of right and wrong onto our feathered companions. Similar to live in the wild, your bird be a few generations removed from the wild and will display natural Understanding these basic characteristics helps you understand how to interact with bird and creates a happier flock for all. The Lunging or Biting Bird One must be cautious to label “bad” behavior as dominant behavior. Lunging and biting are most often caused by fear. Changing a bird’s too drastically such as cage placement, a new cage, rearranging the furniture a room or even something simple as changing the drapery on the window next to their cage can cause even a friendly bird to become seemingly aggressive. It is important to consider environmental changes before labeling your bird’s behavior as dominant. Typical dominant behavior that manifests itself as biting or lunging would bird loves to sit only on your shoulder and bites you you remove them. Protecting a favorite person or place in your home by lunging or biting at who happen to too close also be correctly labeled as dominant behavior. The Bully Bird You may have a situation where keep more than one bird cage. a flock that works well together you will be able to tell the dominant male is but it not adversely affect your flock. If you have male that is a bully, you may observe him forcing other birds off of their perch or guarding a food dish not letting anyone else eat from it. scenarios, your bully single out victim and force that bird to dwell at the bottom of the cage or even injure and possibly kill this weaker bird. If you a dominant bully, it is to remove him from the and keep in a cage by himself or with his mate. The Anti-Social Bird As much you try your bird has no interest becoming friend. This bird often flutters around its to avoid your or takes to flight to escape your reach. I find behavior typical of a bird unclipped wings.

By the very act of keeping a as a pet, you are choosing to take this wonderful winged creature and it into your friend or companion. If take this action, it the purpose of the animal. If you allow your bird to retain the ability of flight, you are permitting bird to escape reach and do whatever it wants. This may be fine, if you want a wild bird as a pet. However, you a friendly bird, you want a bird dependent you, a bird that does not fly away just because it wants to.

Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside hollow bones. The substance of bone is made up of a network of fibrous tissue onto which calcium are down. This makes the bone very hard and At each end of the bone is softer tissue called cartilage acts as a cushion between The outside of the bone covered layer of tissue. The bone itself contains of cells. Osteoblasts are cells that form the bone. Osteoclasts are cells that bone. Although we think that bone does not change, the truth is that it is very active. bone is always forming and old dissolving. The marrow of some bones is only fatty tissue. other bones is a mixture of fat cells and the cells that make blood cells. These blood-forming cells make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Types of bone tumors of time someone is they cancer in their bones, the doctor is talking about a cancer that started somewhere else and then spread to the bone. This is called metastatic cancer (not bone cancer). This can happen to with different types of advanced cancer, as cancer, cancer, lung cancer, and many others. Under a microscope, theses cancer in the bone look like the cancer cells that they came from. If someone has lung cancer has spread to the bone, the cells there will look and act like lung cancer cells and they will be treated the same way. To learn more about cancer that has spread bone, please see the Cancer Society Bone Metastasis, as well as the document on the place where the started (Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer (Non-Small Cell), Prostate Cancer, etc.). Other kinds cancers that are sometimes called “bone cancers” start in the bone – in the cells – not the bone itself. These are true bone most common these is multiple Certain lymphomas (which more often start in lymph nodes) and all leukemias start in bone marrow. To learn more about these cancers, refer to the document for each. A primary tumor starts in the bone itself. True (or primary) bone cancers called sarcomas. A sarcoma is a cancer that starts in bone, tendons, ligaments, fat tissue, or some other tissues in the body. There different types of bone tumors. Their names are based on the or tissue that is involved and the kind of cells that make up the tumor. Some are cancer (malignant). Others are not cancer (benign). Most bone cancers are called sarcomas. Benign bone tumors do not spread to tissues organs. They can usually be cured by surgery. The information here does not cover benign bone tumors. Bone tumors are cancer Osteosarcoma: (also called osteogenic sarcoma) is the most common true bone cancer. It is most common in young people between the ages of 10 and 30. But about 10% of cases are people in their 60s and 70s. This cancer is rare during middle age. More males than females get this These tumors start most often in bones of the arms, legs, or pelvis. This type of bone cancer is not discussed in this document, but covered in in our document, Osteosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma: This is cancer of the cartilage cells. a softer form of tissue. Chondrosarcoma is the second most common true bone cancer. It is rare people younger than 20. After age 20, the risk of this cancer keeps on rising until about age 75. Women get this cancer as often as men. Chondrosarcomas can develop in place where is cartilage. It most starts in cartilage of the pelvis, or arm, but it start in many other places, too. Chondrosarcomas are given a grade, which measures how fast they grow. The lower the grade, the slower the cancer grows.

Despite the fact that the temperature rise has so far relatively modest, “we do have a crisis,” he said. With his characteristic under-stated manner, Hansen made compelling case. But after speaking with two NOAA scientists today, I think Hansen put himself in a familiar position: out on a scientific limb. And after sifting through my many pages of notes from two days of immersion in climate issues, I’m as convinced as that journalists must be exceedingly careful not to what we and what is up for scientific Crawling out on the limb, Hansen argued that global warming has already caused the of water in Lake Powell and Lake Mead — the giant reservoirs on the Colorado River than insure water supplies for of of Westerners — to fall to 50 percent of capacity. The “probably will not be full again unless we decrease CO2 in the atmosphere,” he asserted. Hansen is that simply reducing our emissions and stabilizing CO2 at about 450 parts per million, as many scientists argue is necessary, is not nearly good enough. We must reduce the concentration from today’s 387 to below 35o ppm. “We already passed into the dangerous zone,” Hansen said. If we reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, “we would be sending planet toward an ice free state. We would have a chaotic journey get we would be creating very different planet, and chaos our Hansen’s argument (see a paper on the subject here) based on paleoclimate data which show that the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were this high, the Earth was ice free, and sea level was higher than it is today. “I agree with the sense of urgency,” said Peter Tans, a carbon cycle expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration here in Boulder, in a meeting with our Ted Fellows in Environmental Journalism. “But I don’t agree with a lot of the I don’t agree with Jim Hansen’s naming of 350 ppm as a tipping point. Actually we may have already gone too far, we just don’t know.” A key Tans said, is timing. “If it takes a years for the caps disappear, problem. The issue is how fast? Nobody can give that answer.” Martin Hoerling, a NOAA meteorologist who is working on ways to better the links between change and regional impacts, as drought in the West, pointed out that the data Hansen bases his assertions on are coarse. They do not record year-to-year events, just changes that took place over very long time periods. that data give no indication just how long it takes to de-glaciate Antarctica and Greenland. Hoerling also took issue with Hansen’s assertions about Powell and Mead. it is true that West has had the most radical in temperature in the U.S.,” there is no evidence yet that this is a cause increasing drought, he said. Flows in the Colorado River have been averaging about 12 acre each year, yet we are consuming 14 million acre feet. “Where are we getting the extra from? Well, we’re tapping into our 401K plan,” he said. That would be the two giant and that’s why their water levels have been declining. “Why is there less flow in the river?” Hoerling said. “Low precipitation — not every year, but many recent the snow pack has been lower.” And here’s almost counter-intuitive point: science shows that the reduced precipitation “is to natural climate variability . . . We see little indication that the warming trend affecting the precipitation.” In my conversation with Tans and Hoerling today, I saw a tension between what they believe and they think they can demonstrate scientifically. “I like to frame issue differently,” said. “Sure, we canot predict what the climate is going to look like in a couple of There are feedbacks in the system we understand. In fact, we don’t even know all feedbacks . . To pick all apart is extremely difficult — until things happen. So I’m pessimistic.” There is, Tans said, “a risk of catastrophic climate change. Maybe it is 1 in 6, or maybe 1 in 20 or 1 Yet if we had a risk like that of being an asteroid, we’d know what to do. But the problem here is are the asteroid.” Tans argues that whether or not we can pin down the degree of risk we are now facing, one is obvious: have society based on ever increasing consumption and economic expecta",

There is a genetic component alcoholism, and people grow in alcoholic homes are far more likely to themselves. Children born to alcoholic parents, raised in homes without alcohol abuse or addiction are predisposed to alcoholism, so do that genetics plays an important role. But all people genetically predisposed to alcoholism do not develop dependencies, and some people with no genetic history of alcoholism up battling the disease for years. It is now accepted that although a genetic predisposition plays an important influence in the development of the disease, that social and environmental are in fact the lager influences towards alcohol abuse or alcoholism. In addition to genetic Mayo Clinic considers that there three additional primary to abuse or alcoholism. Emotional States or Emotional Stressors can Induce Abuse and Alcoholism People may use alcohol excessively in response to frequent or significant emotional disturbances or When alcohol is with enough frequency as an emotional management or stress tool the risk of dependency or increases greatly. There is also likely bio physical link with stress and alcohol abuse, and stress hormones have been casually linked to increased alcohol consumption and a greater risk for alcoholism. People who alcohol deal with life's problems or stresses are at greater risk to develop alcoholism. The of a Corresponding Psychiatric Condition People suffering through psychiatric like depression, bi polar disorder, borderline personality disorder or anxiety disorders are at a greatly elevated risk to develop alcohol abuse problems or alcoholism. Psychiatric patients often use alcohol or other illicit to self medicate the negative symptoms of an experienced disorder. Unfortunately, while intoxication may bring some relief, the long term effects of alcohol almost always experienced psychiatric symptoms. are at a great risk an accelerated progression of diseases, and require interventions and treatment. In addition to clinical psychiatric conditions, non clinical, but still significant factors such as low self esteem can also increase the likelihood to alcohol abuse, and ultimately alcoholism. Alcohol is rarely an term coping strategy. Social Environmental Factors As a society, largely due to billions of dollars invested in alcohol campaigns, there is a perception of alcohol being associated with glamour, attractiveness and and these lingering subconscious perceptions may influence people to try alcohol at a young and continue to drink more than they should throughout life. The immediate environment can also increase the probability of alcoholism. who socialize, or romantically with a person drinks to excess, whether dependent not, are far likely also drink heavily, put themselves at risk for alcohol abuse and alcoholism. Even the neighborhood around the home seems to consumption patterns, and people brought up in or who reside in of heavy abuse also more likely to use and abuse alcohol themselves. Nothing about alcoholism is completely understood, and all we know is that the variables that can induce alcohol abuse and ultimately alcoholism are and that what may cause dependence in one, seem have little influence over another. We present with an individual risk profile for our susceptibility to the disease, although people with a genetic history of are undoubtedly an increased risk to disease. Regardless of the factors that may induce the occurrence of the disease, the treatments are essentially the same, and alcoholics need intervention, intensive treatment, and long term aftercare therapies. Most alcoholics will be capable of drinking in moderation, and abstinence is the only recommended philosophy of use for people with alcoholic histories. last updated Sep 23, 2012",

What are the challenges students with PDD/ASD frequently experience? - Academic difficulties can often misinterpreted as disabilities. - Problems with executive functioning skills. - Difficulty in forming relationships peers. Emotional difficulties due to learning and social problems such as depression, low self-esteem. - Fear of new situations and trouble adjusting to changes. - May look like or be misconstrued as attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Nonverbal Learning Disability Oppositional-Defiant Disorder or Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

But, for a beginner, following these MSDN articles can be intimidating say the least. One of the most asked questions see a Visual C++ and Visual Basic programmer is how to call a VB DLL from VC++. Well, I am hoping show you that today. I not going to go over the basic details of COM as would take too long, so I am assuming you an understanding VB, VC++ and a little COM knowledge. It's not too hard to learn; just takes little time. So let's get started. The first thing you to do is fire up Visual Basic 6 (VB 5 should work as well). With VB running, create a new \"ActiveX DLL\" project. Rename the project to \"vbTestCOM\" and the class to \"clsTestClass\". You can do by clicking in the VB Project Explorer Window on the Project1 item (Step 1), then clicking in Properties window and selecting the name property (Step 2). Do the same the on the class (Step 3), then the name property and enter the name mentioned above (Step 4). Your project so far should look like the folowing right hand side picture: Ok, we are ready to add some to the VB Class. Click on the \"Tools\" menu, then select the \"Add Procedure\" menu item. The Add Procedure will In this window we need to add some information. First (Step make sure the type is set to Function. Second (Step 2) a Function name called Finally hit the Ok and VB will generate the new function in the class. You have an empty function with which to work. The first thing we will do is specify a return type and an input your code to look like this: Public Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long What are we doing here? We are taking one parameter, as String type case, then the length through the return type, which is a Long. We specify the input parameter as ByVal, meaning VB make a copy of this variable and the copy in the rather than the default ByRef, which passes variable by reference. This way we can that we do not modify the string by accident that was passed to us by the calling program. Let's add the code now. Public Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As As If strValue = vbNullString Then CountStringLength = 0 CountStringLength = Len(strValue) In the first line of code we are to see if the calling program passed us an empty, or NULL, string. If so we return 0 as If the user did pass something other than empty string, then we count length and return the length back to the calling program. Now would be a good time to save your project. the default names and it in safe directory. We need to compile this project Go to the File menu and select the \"Make vbCOMTest.dll...\" menu item. compiler will produce a file called surprisingly enough: vbCOMTest.dll. The compiler also do us the favor of entering this new DLL into the system registry. We have finished the VB side of this project, so let's start the VC++ side of it. Fire up a copy of then select from the menu, \"New Project\". The New Project window appear. Select \"Win32 Console Application\" 1), give it name of \"TestVBCOM\" (Step 2). Finally, enter a directory you want to build this project in (Step 3 - your directory will vary from what have entered). on the \"OK\" button and the \"Win32 Console Application Step 1 of 1\" window appear. everything this page as the default, click the \"Finish\" button. One final window appear after this titled \"New Project Information\". Simply click the \"Ok\" button You should now have an empty Win32 Console Press the \"Ctrl\" and hit the \"N\" key. Another window titled \"New\" will appear. Select the \"C++ Source File\" (Step 1), then enter the for this file called, \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" 2 make sure the Add Project checkbox is and the correct name is in drop down combo box), then click the \"Ok\" button finish. Now we are going to get fancy! You need to go your Menu in Windows and navigate to the \"Visual Studio menu and go into the \"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 sub-menu. In here you will see an icon with the name \"OLE View\". Click it. The OLE View tool will open up. You will see a window similar this one: Collapse all the trees, if they are already. This will it easier navigate where we want to go. Highlight the \"Type Libraries\" (Step 1) expand it. You should see a fairly massive listing. We need to locate our VB DLL. Now, remember named the project? Right, we need to look for vbTestCOM. Scroll down you find this. you have found it, double click on it. A new window should appear - \"ITypeLib Viewer\" window.

The following year Commodore Matthew Perry embarked upon his expedition to re-open Japan to the Western world and establish trade. beyond its borders in many ways, a few years earlier the United States had joined the worldwide move to uniform postage rates and printed stamps when the Congressional Act of March 3, 1845 U.S. postage stamps, and set the local prepaid letter rate at five cents. This set the stage for a close connection between postal and history. six years the postage rate was reduced to three cents when New York Daniel S. Dickinson fathered legislation that simultaneously initiated coinage of tiny silver three-cent piece as public convenience. The large then in circulation were cumbersome and unpopular, and the new denomination was designed to facilitate the purchase stamps without using the \"coppers.\" This was carried a further when Mint Act February 1853 authorized a three-dollar gold coin. Congress and Mint Director Robert Maskell Patterson were convinced that the new coin would speed purchases of three-cent stamps by the sheet and of the silver coins roll quantities. Unfortunately, at no time during 35-year span this denomination did public demand justify these hopes. Chief Engraver James Barton Longacre an \"Indian Princess\" for his obverse not a Native American profile, but actually a profile modeled after the Greco-Roman Venus Accroupie then in a Philadelphia Longacre used this distinctive sharp-nosed profile on his gold dollar of 1849 and employ it again on the Indian Head cent of 1859. On the three-dollar coin Liberty is wearing a feathered headdress of equal-sized plumes with a band LIBERTY in raised letters. She's by inscription UNITED STATES AMERICA. Such a headdress dates to the earliest known drawings of American French Jacques le Moyne du Morgue's sketches of the Florida Timucua who lived near the tragic French colony of Fort Caroline in 1562. It was accepted engravers and medalists of the day the design shorthand for \"America.\" Longacre's reverse depicted a wreath of tobacco, wheat, corn and cotton with a plant at bearing two seed masses. The original wax models of this wreath still exist on discs in a Midwestern and show how meticulous Longacre in preparing his design. Encircled the wreath is the 3 DOLLARS and the date. There are two reverse types, the small DOLLARS appearing only in 1854 the large DOLLARS on coins Many dates show bold \"outlining\" of letters and devices, resembling a double strike but the result of excessive forcing of the design into the die steel, causing a hint of their sloping \"shoulders\" to appear as part of the coin's design. The points of the obverse design that first show wear are cheek and hair above the eye; on the reverse, the bow knot and leaves. A total of just over 535,000 pieces were issued along with 2058 proofs. The first coins struck were the 15 proofs of Regular coinage began on May 1, and that first saw 138,618 pieces struck at Philadelphia (no mintmark), 1,120 Dahlonega (D), at New Orleans (O). These two branch mints would strike only in 1854. San produced the three-dollar denomination in 1855, 1856, and 1857, again in 1860, and apparently one final piece in 1870. Mintmarks are found below the wreath. Every denomination boasts number major rarities. The gold coinage of 1854-1889 is studded with so many low-mintage dates that the series may fairly be called rare. mint state 1878 is the most common date, followed by the 1879, 1888, 1854 and 1889 issues. Every other date is very in high grade, particularly 1858, 1865, 1873 Closed 3 and all the San Francisco issues. Minuscule mintages were the rule in the later years.

For those who desire the look hardwood flooring but are concerned about the environmental consequences of harvesting trees, bamboo offers the perfect solution. bamboo is not technically wood flooring, its appearance is close to fool even the most discerning eye. Why is Bamboo Flooring Considered Environmentally Friendly? Although bamboo is actually a type of grass, it is harder than red oak. It reaches full maturity in just 3 to 5 years rather than several decades and appears naturally the need for replanting. Harvesting bamboo is actually somewhat required because it is so hardy that leaving it to its own devices would put a strain the environment. would be terrible shame to waste the harvested material, so people have designed many ways to put it to good use from thatched roofs to flooring Bamboo also no requirements for irrigation, fertilizers, or pesticides when grown in its natural environment.

There are several involved in a material suitable flooring from bamboo. Upon harvest, the is boiled to remove its natural starches and which could become a wonderful for termites not The outer skin is then removed and the is cut into strips for flooring. These strips are boiled again to make them even or the longer the carbonation process, the darker the color of the final product.

An international team of dietitians, doctors and other examined more than a dozen ideas about obesity are widely believed to be true but aren’t actually supported by reliable medical evidence. dieters who buy into these mistaken notions, note – much of this incorrect wisdom is espoused by physicians, academic scientists, government agencies and the media. Seven of these errant ideas as “myths,” meaning they are “beliefs held to be true despite substantial refuting evidence.” Another six were as “presumptions,” or held to be true for which convincing evidence does not yet confirm or disprove truth.” Without ado, let’s get to the Eating a little less exercising a little more will lead to large weight time, as as those behaviors are sustained. This myth is on the idea 3,500 calories are equal one pound. That equation was based on short-term experiments. In the long-term, the body compensates in various ways that slow down loss. For instance, the equation predicts that a person who burns extra per day will lose more than 50 pounds over five years; in reality, that exercise regimen cause a to shed about 10 pounds (assuming calorie intake remains the same). It’s to set realistic weight-loss goals so dieters don’t frustrated. Studies that examined reasonable-sounding have found that having realistic goals has no impact on the amount of weight lost. Indeed, some studies have found that those who set the most ambitious goals lost the weight, even if they fell short of initial expectations. gradual weight loss is easier to sustain than large, rapid loss. In fact, clinical have found that people who jump-start their diets by dropping a lot of weight in the beginning (by consuming only 800 to 1,200 calories per day, for instance) had the best results long-term studies. In order to help someone lose weight, gauge their readiness to a diet. Experimental evidence shows that readiness isn’t related to diet results. School P.E. classes help reduce prevent childhood obesity. While there is certainly some amount of physical education that would help fight childhood obesity, classes in their current form have not shown to reduce BMI or obesity in kids on a consistent basis. Babies who are breast-fed are less likely become obese. you think this is true, you’re in good company – the World Health Organization presented this “fact” in one of its reports. But a randomized, controlled clinical trial that 13,000 children for more than six years found “no compelling evidence” breastfeeding staves off obesity, according to the New England Journal of Medicine report. (The did note that breastfeeding has other benefits and should be anyway.) You can burn 100 to 300 calories by having sex.

But wait, it gets Considering that this man could burn calories just watching TV, the true benefit of having sex is only additional calories The report also says that these ideas are just likely to be false as true: * breakfast instead skipping it will prevent obesity. * Long-term eating and exercise habits are set in early childhood. * Regardless of what else you do, eating more fruits and will lead to weight loss (or less weight gain). * Yo-yo dieting will take or years off your life. * Snacking will make you gain weight. * The availability of sidewalks, parks and other aspects of the “built environment” the of obesity.

A recent presentation at the 2012 Western Pacific Geophysics meeting in Singapore showed C-14 dates of soft tissue found in bones to be in the range from 22,000 - 39,000 years old. Previously, it has been assumed dinosaurs died out over million years ago, so these new findings are astonishing and should have made international news.

So it appears that instead of making international news, these findings have been buried. let’s look at was actually being presented. The organic matter (collagen) and hard carbonate bone mineral (bioapatite) in the bone samples were analyzed. The samples came from several species of dinosaurs (acrocanthosaur, hadrosaurus, triceratops and apatosaurus) taken from sites in Colorado, Arkansas and Montana. samples were meticulously handled and cleaned to avoid possible contamination. The levels in these samples were measured using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The resultant C-14 ages obtained from these consistently in the - 39,000 years range. The fact that the samples were from a variety of species and sites all giving results greatly the chance that the results are from contamination. The theoretical upper limit for C-14 dating is ten times the half-life, or about 57,000 years. The proposed practical upper limit for C-14 dating is between 40,000 - 50,000 years. While some samples fell close to the 40,000 upper limit, 16 out of 20 (80%) were aged at 35,000 years or younger, well within the acceptable upper C-14 dating limits. While other researchers soft tissue in dinosaur and C-14 dates in these ranges, this current study has the most comprehensive. The fact that there is any collagen at all remaining these bone samples is amazing, considering that they are supposed to be older than 65 million years.

Then it became as large as Tengaimon gate in Nara, and finally as big as the main two-story gates of the Ninnaji and Todaiji temples in This image occurred not just because I had the opportunity to see gates dating from that period, but because of what was learning, from documents relics, about the long-since-destroyed Rashomon gate itself. “Rashomon” refers the Rajomon gate; the name was changed in a Kanze Nobumitsu. “Rajo” indicates the outer precincts of the castle, “Rajomon” means the main gate to the castle’s outer grounds. The gate for my film Rashomon was main gate the outer precincts of the ancient capital--–--–Kyoto was at that time “Heian-Kyo.” If one entered the capital through the Rajomon gate and continued north along the of the metropolis, one came to the gate at the end it, and the Toji and Saiji temples to the east and west, respectively.

It was a very well-written piece, but not long enough to make into a feature film. This Hashimoto had visited my home, and talked him for hours. He seemed to have substance, and I took a to him. He wrote the screenplays for Ikiru (1952) and Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai, 1954) with me. The script I remembered was his Akutagawa adaptation called “Male-Female.” Probably my subconscious me it was not right to have put that script aside; probably I was—without being aware of it–wondering all the while if I couldn’t do something with it. At that moment the memory of it jumped out one of those creases in my brain and told me to give it a chance. At the same time I recalled that “In a Grove” is made up of three stories, and realized that if I added one more, the whole would be just",

He preached to the birds, pacified wolf, and put together an animal cast for is regarded as the very first live nativity scene. But he had no interest in environment.” No feeling for it whatsoever. Instead, he love creation. And that’s because he was in love with the Creator, he not as some cosmic force or distant, detached monarch, but as “Father.” He so much loved God his Father that he had great affection for anything to God – the sacraments, the Church, its very imperfect ministers, down country chapels, of God’s marvelous works of art – beings first foremost, but also the animals and even the inanimate objects that adorn the heavens and the earth. The fondness for and kinship St. Francis felt with son sister moon” was truly a gift. But it is gift that we all receive when we receive the Holy Spirit since it is one of the seven gifts mentioned in 11:2-3. At this is how St. Thomas Aquinas and many after him explained this beautiful, supernatural gift of piety. The natural virtue of piety was extolled by the Greeks and Romans – a love of those who gave you life, first and foremost your parents and after them, fatherland. This entailed also a and affection for all that is connected with your parents and dear to as grandparents, uncles and aunts, and in the case of your country, its flag, its national anthem, its history and its heros. The term for piety towards one’s country is actually at its root, the term “pater” or “father.” St. Francis loved his home Assisi. But deeper patriotism was for the Kingdom of His affection for the Kingdom included respect and reverence for all the King’s creatures and subjects, they be or small. this does not mean that Francis saw all creatures as his equals, as some animal rights advocates today to do. One animal rights philosopher, Peter Singer, goes so far as to teach that adult whales and chimpanzees actually superior to human fetuses and infants in both dignity and value. He would save the whales but allow both abortion and infanticide. St. Francis would be appalled at such a concept. Biblical person that he was, he understood that and man are God’s supreme masterpieces, made in His image and likeness, unlike the animals. Human beings are given dominion over rest of in Genesis not to exploit however, but to cultivate, care for, and perfect. God entrusts Adam and Eve with “the environment,” but with “the – a place of beauty in which we made to walk with God. So St. Francis loves the but also presses them into service of the gospel. He saves the wolf Gubbio the wrath townspeople, but rebukes it for its ferocity and calls men and wolf to live everafter in harmony. And the animals the nativity scene? They are companions of the infant who is the made flesh. So the authentic biblical and Catholic approach to “the environment” is not to see it and scientifically as “the environment.” But rather, in the fashion of Francis, approach it as the expression of the Father’s beauty, as gift of the Father’s love, as icon, a window to the new creation. Reckless exploitation would never fit with such a vision. neither would some secular environmentalism. Follow - us on Facebook Join us on Twitter Dr. D’Ambrosio writes from Texas.

Approximately half of the investigational new therapeutics in human clinical trials for AD are active passive immunotherapeutics. Active vaccination involves the injection of an antigen and on the production of antibodies in the vaccinated patient. human clinical trials of active vaccination currently are under way. Passive immunization is also a promising strategy that involves the production outside of the patient and injection of these antibodies. There currently 12 clinical trials of passive immunization. You can check Alzheimer therapeutics in human clinical trials by www.clinicaltrials.gov and searching key words “Alzheimer’s and immunotherapy.” Thinking out of the box The development vaccinations a strategy for treating preventing Alzheimer’s is an example of out of the box. Vaccinations commonly are associated with infectious diseases, like influenza, small pox and which appear have in common with like Alzheimer’s. Moreover, the brain is immunoprivileged site with little access to antibodies, so it seems unlikely antibodies would be protective in the brain. Researchers were pleasantly surprised when Dale Schenk and co-workers at Elan Inc. reported that vaccination of transgenic models of against the amyloid Aß peptide prevented amyloid deposition in removed pre-existing amyloid deposits in older animals. Subsequent work showed against Aß prevented reversed many other features and prevented cognitive dysfunction in transgenic mice and non-human primates. This vaccine (Elan AN1792) was tested in human clinical where it showed similar beneficial effects of removing amyloid deposits and slowing cognitive decline in patients with levels anti-Aß but the clinical trial was halted because 6 percent of the patients developed meningoencephalitis, an inflammatory side effect. Second-generation vaccines and passive immunization circumvent the unwanted inflammatory side effects, active have been developed and passive immunization strategies have been explored. The second-generation vaccines use small of the amyloid Aß sequence to activating the T-cells responsible for meningoencephalitis, while passive immunization bypasses the human immune response by directly antibodies. These newer strategies have shown the same beneficial effects in transgenic mice and passive immunization has shown some promise in a subset of patients in human trials, but they have raised new questions about their effectiveness and potential new side effects. Elan/Wyeth reported preliminary from clinical trials of their monoclonal Bapineuzimab, that demonstrated only a small benefit in a subgroup of patients who lack the apoE4 genotype. also failed to observe an improved benefit with an increased dose of antibody and reported side effects, like a buildup of fluid in the brain. Results of active vaccination human trials with second-generation vaccines remain to be reported. vaccines and antibodies: Thinking perpendicular to the box Both second-generation vaccines and antibodies suffer from a problem. both target linear amino acid in normal human proteins amyloid precursor protein) and in the amyloid deposits Making antibodies against normal human proteins cause autoimmune side effects, in which the immune system is attacking human cells in addition to Alzheimer’s Fortunately, it is difficult to make antibodies against self-proteins of immune suppression of auto antibodies. Third-generation vaccines seek to overcome these problems of autoimmune side effects and autoimmune suppression by using antibodies that target structures specific to the amyloid aggregates and that do not proteins. Cure Alzheimer’s Fund has been supporting two projects that seek to develop third-generation immunotherapeutics.

Several alcohols belong to compounds which are found in environmental or food systems (see the website: Flavornet). They found with normal, branched (mono- or isoprenoid), saturated or unsaturated of various chain length and sometimes with secondary or even alcoholic function. An unusual phenolic alcohol is found a component in alcohols have been described in plants. A classification according to the carbon-chain is given below. 1 - Normal-chain alcohols The may be saturated or unsaturated (with and/or triple bonds), it may also be with chlorine, bromine or sulfate groups. Some acetylenic alcohols have been described. Among the most common, are listed below 9-methyl-1-hendecanol (anteisolauryl alcohol) 11-methyl-1-tridecanol (anteisomyristyl alcohol) 14-methyl-1-pentadecanol (isopalmityl alcohol) 13-methyl-1-pentadecanol (anteisopalmityl alcohol) 16-methyl-1-heptadecanol alcohol) 15-methyl-1-pentadecanol (anteisostearyl alcohol) Free fatty are not commonly in epicuticular lipids of insects, although high weight alcohols have been reported in honeybees (Blomquist GJ et al., Insect Biochem 10, 313). Long-chain alcohols also have been reported in the defensive secretions of scale insects (Byrne DN et al., Entomol 1988, 13,267). Typically, insects more commonly produce lower molecular weight alcohols. produce alcohols of 17–22 carbons, arrestment in parasitic varroa mites (Donze G et al., Arch Insect Physiol 1998, 37, 129). Two female-specific fatty alcohols, docosanol (C22) and eicosanol (C20), which have been found epicuticle of Triatoma infestans vector of Chagas disease in South America), are able to trigger copulation in (Cocchiararo-Bastias L et al., J Chem Ecol 2011, 37, 246).

Various fatty alcohols are found in the waxy film that plants have over their leaves and Among them, octacosanol (C28:0) is the most frequently cited. Policosanol is a natural mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols isolated and purified from sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum, wax, whose main component is octacosanol but contains hexacosanol (C26:0) and triacontanol or melissyl alcohol (C30:0). Policosanol is also extracted from a diversity of other natural sources such as beeswax, rice wheat germ (Irmak S et al., Food Chem 2006, 95, 312) is also present in the fruits, leaves, and surfaces of plants and whole seeds. A complex policosanol mixture been identified in peanut et al., J Agric Food Chem 2010, 58, 12143). More than 20 alcohols were identified (C14-C30) and four unsaturated alcohols (C20-24). The total policosanol content of the whole peanut samples varied from 11 to 54 mg/100 g of oil. This mixture was shown to have cholesterol-lowering effects in rabbits (Arruzazabala ML et al., Biol Res 27, 205). Octacosanol was also able to suppress lipid in rats fed on a high-fat diet (Kato S et al., Br 1995, 73, 433) and to inhibit platelet aggregation (Arruzazabala ML et al., Thromb Res 1993, 69, 321).

More recent studies in mice question about action on improvement of lipoprotein profiles (Dullens et al., J Lipid Res 2008, 49, 790). The authors conclude that individual policosanols, as well as natural policosanol mixtures, have no potential for reducing coronary heart disease through effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations. cane policosanol at doses of mg daily has shown no lipid lowering effects in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia (Francini-Pesenti et Phytother Res 2008, 22, 318).

Immunity (say im-yoon-it-i) means you are protected against something. There are different kinds of immunity. This topic is about how different parts of our bodies work together to keep from sick. Immunity to some diseases is passed on our mothers before we are born. Immunisation (having your helps our immune defence system protect us from . body's immune Every body has an inbuilt immune system which protects it from diseases and germs. This system a lot of different parts which work together to keep out any harmful germs, and attack and destroy any manage to get inside your body - Every day your body is exposed to millions of germs, and you do not get from them because your immune system. Every time do get sick because of a germ, your immune system works to get of it and then how to fight the infection the same germ comes again. - Usually the older you get, the germs you become immune to. So, let's have a look at the immune system, starting from outside of the body. The skin is the first line in your immune system. You know how you put plastic wrap leftovers to keep them fresh enough for later? Well, your skin is like a plastic wrap to keep germs from getting into body. - The epidermis (outside layer of skin) has special cells which warn the body about incoming germs. - Glands in the skin also make substances that can some bacteria (anti-bacterial chemicals). means you don't get infections on your skin unless your skin is damaged, as by a cut or a graze. Your mouth and eyes are the next point of attack. - The mucous membranes which line the mouth, throat, lungs and act like a barrier to just as the skin does. - Saliva in the mouth and the tears which wash your eyes have special enzymes (chemicals) in them which break down the cell walls of many bacteria and viruses. - that is made in your nose, throat lungs traps bacteria, viruses and dust. - Acid in your stomach most germs, and starts to food. - Lymph (limf) is a clear fluid that is very similar to blood plasma, the clear liquid in blood, but it carries only white red blood cells. The lymph flows through all the of the body fluid around cells and carrying it back to large veins near the heart. It carries white blood cells to places that they are needed. - Some or viruses that have entered the body are collected the lymph and passed on to the lymph nodes where they are filtered out and destroyed. Lymph nodes are sometimes called glands. doctor can often if you have infection by checking out the lymph nodes (glands) in your neck and under your arms to see if they're If are, it shows that they are working to get bacteria or viruses. In your blood you have red blood cells and white cells, and in lymph there are white blood cells. are several different types of white cells which together to seek out and destroy bacteria and viruses. All of them start in the bone marrow, growing from 'stem cells'. The disease-fighting white blood cells specialists. Some of the white blood cells are: - Neutrophils (say new-tro-fills), which move the body in the blood and seek foreign material that don't belong in your - Macrophages (say mak-row-far-jes) are the biggest blood cells. Some live in different parts of the body and help to keep it clean, eg. in the lungs. Others swim around cleaning other white blood cells that have been damaged while doing their jobs, eg. cleaning up pus that has been caused by neutrophils when they work to clear out bacteria from a wound. - Lymphocytes (say lim-fo-sites) work on bacterial and viral infections are two different types: - B cells produce antibodies. Each cell watches out for a particular germ, and when that germ arrives, the cell starts produce more antibodies which process of killing that germ.

On the one hand, efficiency has steadily improved over the last couple decades to the point it’s the utility prices of other power generation methods. Exotic promise greater gains. However, the price of solar-generated power still remains least five as expensive as coal-power, the source of power in U.S. (compared to the leading candidate, nuclear, which is approximately to 2 times expensive). While solar adoption from a cost is unattractive, there's much debate over whether commercial adoption is needed to spur further research to propel solar into the realm of cost competitiveness. While many nations like the U.S. and have modestly taken this position, adopting solar at a moderate rate, one nation has fallen head heels for solar -- Spain. Spain is allowing solar and wind power plants to charge as much as 10 times the rates of power plants, making it possible for power installations earn utilities big money. On average, recent rate increases solar charges to over 7 times the rates of coal or natural gas rates. The costs are added onto consumers' power The results are mixed; while Spanish power bills are at record highs, the number of deployments is soaring. Spain has 14 GW of solar power, or the capacity of average nuclear reactors, under construction -- the most of any nation. Florida’s FPL Group Inc. and French Electricite de France SA are among the many jumping to build in Spain.

Spanish law requires power distributors to buy all clean energy produced in the first 25 years of plants' lives.

The main symptom of CCD is simply no a low number of adult bees present but with live queen and no dead honey bees in the hive. Often is still honey in the hive, and immature bees (brood) present.

She often seemed to be ignoring her parents when they spoke to her, and when she did respond, many her words were slurred. Concerned, parents arranged a hearing -- and that Nina had moderate hearing loss in both ears. Outfitted with a hearing aid, and provided with speech therapy, she is just beginning to regain some the ground she lost during the first of life when important language skills are being learned. \"Hearing impairment is the largest congenital disability, affecting about six out of every 1,000 infants,\" says Duke pediatric audiologist Ann Mabie. \"For a very long time, people thought you couldn't test infants' hearing, and would just wait until children were two or three old. But by the time wait for children not to talk, a window of opportunity has shut.\" In fact, those tiny, shell-like that parents marvel over when getting to know their new babies are just the most visible parts of a highly sophisticated machine. Human infants spend the first year of life learning about their environment, and by one year of age, already understand far more language than they are yet able -- unless an hearing impairment disrupts process. While hearing impairments are difficult at any age, they’re especially devastating in young children, because their brains rely on auditory stimulation to develop the capacity for oral communication. This makes early diagnosis and treatment of childhood hearing losses essential. Happily, all newborns in North Carolina now have access to the specialized screening to diagnose infants with hearing loss, thanks to state legislation passed in October 1999. Even babies born with normal hearing, however, can develop a hearing loss later in infancy or childhood, due to ear infections or head injuries. So parents should of clues that their might have difficulty hearing and on tests if they suspect hearing (see below). Mabie parents who suspect that their child might have a hearing problem to get the child tested by an audiologist or physician with expertise in this area as as \"Every day you wait is a day lost.\" Hearing impairments caused by problems in and outer ear can sometimes be treated medically. For impairments originating in the inner ear, a hearing aid and speech therapy can help. \"Hearing aids provide access to speech, and with some intensive speech and language therapy, hearing-impaired kids will do fine in a normal classroom.\" Children with severe to profound hearing impairments typically will more extensive rehabilitation, and cochlear implantation be indicated. At Duke, otolaryngologists have begun using new technologies to help even tiny children with hearing impairments to interact with the hearing world. When Lauren, a two-month-old infant from western North Carolina, was diagnosed with hearing loss to a malformation in her inner ears, or cochleas, she was immediately fitted with hearing aids. Shortly before her second birthday, she came to Duke for a cochlear implant. specialists in speech pathology and audiology worked to perform a detailed evaluation of Lauren’s loss, using the most diagnostic technologies available. Duke neurotologist (ear specialist) Debara then selected the cochlear implant that would be most appropriate for Lauren. After Tucci surgically implanted the mechanism -- marvel of micro-engineering -- into Lauren’s ear, the tiny computer chip that controls the was carefully to transmit auditory signals Lauren’s brain. The result is a girl who is learning how to communicate with around her on schedule. Whatever intervention a with deficiencies may need, time is of the essence. As the mother of one hearing-impaired puts it, \"Once you find out and take action, things only get better, not worse.” If your any of the following behaviors, have or her checked by a professional audiologist or physician with expertise in hearing disorders.",

Doctors know the number of knee replacement operations has surged in the last decade, especially in baby boomers. But until now, there was no good fix on total number people living with them. The estimate important because shows that a big segment of the population might need future knee-related care, said Dr. Daniel Berry, president of the American Academy of Orthopedic and chairman of orthopedic surgery at the Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was not involved the research. People with knee replacements sometimes develop infections or scar tissue require additional treatment. But also, even artificial wear out, so as the operations are increasingly done on younger people, many live long enough to almost certainly need a second or even third knee replacement. “These data are sobering because we didn’t know what an army of people created last decade,” said Elena Losina, lead author of the analysis and co-director of the Orthopedics Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “The numbers will only increase, based on trends.” Replacement joints can greatly improve quality of life for people with worn-out knees, but it’s a major operation that people should lightly, she said. Modern knee replacements in the United States date to the 1970s. Since advances in materials techniques, including imaging scans to create better-fitting joints, have made the implants more durable and lifelike, surgeons Losina and colleagues came up with their estimate by analyzing national data on the number knee replacements done from 1998-2009, U.S. census data, death statistics and national health surveys. For example, in 2009, more than 600,000 knee replacement operations were done The estimate includes people who knee replacement operations that year and in previous years who are still living. Overall, 4.5 million Americans are living with artificial knees. That an estimated 500,000 have had at least two replacement operations on same knee. Knee replacements are most in people older than 80 1 in 10 people in this age have them, the study found. Though they’re less prevalent in people younger than that, there are still than half a million Americans in their 50s with the artificial joints, and based on current trends, operations in that age are expected to increase. According to the federal Agency Healthcare and Quality, knee replacements tripled in people ages 45 to 64 between and 2009. Doctors think two trends contributed to that increase: the nation’s obesity epidemic and amateur athletes who don’t workouts to spare aging or even injured joints. Both can lead to or worsen arthritis, the main reason for replacing knees. Donna Brent, 63, is in category. The Deerfield, Ill., administrative assistant decades of racquetball, tennis, softball and sports took a toll on her but she got used to living with the pain, even when she became bowlegged and developed a limp. When pain “started getting in the way of some of my sports,” she gave in to doctor’s advice and the operation last June on her right knee. She said she feels better than ever, is back to exercising and plans to resume tennis and softball when the weather warms up. During knee replacement surgeons slice off a small portion the surface on ends of both leg bones that meet at the knee, then implant an joint usually made plastic or metal. Typical operations last about two hours, require a few days in hospital and cost $40,000. Artificial knees generally last 15 to 20 years. While some are promoted as lasting 30 estimates are generally based use among older people more sedentary baby boomers who expect new knees to let them be as active as they were before surgery. Sometimes that’s possible, though doctors often discourage knee replacement patients from in high-impact sports including jogging.

People who their lives to save others’ lives and property, including public lands “owned” by the country’s should be treated According to federal labor laws, most firefighters don’t qualify as permanent employees. Even though may in nearly a full year’s of hours during the fire season, the demand for men and women skilled in fighting wildfires drops precipitously during the winter.

Of course, I butchered piece of wood and eventually had to get the right tool, which got the job done in a fraction of the time that I wasted the convenient-to-reach tool. The same lesson applies to power quality tools, which range from a simple to a $24,000, 32-gigahertz (GHz) spectrum analyzer. Not only can you waste time and not answer you are looking for, you might even be led to the wrong answer using the wrong tool for the task. Before going into the variety of tools available, here’s a quick safety reminder. Always assess the hazards and skills required for the task, and ensure you or whoever is doing it a “qualified person” per the National Code definition. Ensure personnel within the possible hazard the proper personal protective equipment per NFPA 70E and other local And wherever possible, make connections de-energized circuits only. Even something as simple as taking a panel cover off to tighten a screw can be don’t always to someone else. On the end of the price range is an item in tool kit: digital multimeter (DMM). A DMM can measure a number of steady-state power quality phenomena, as imbalance. It also be used to find voltage drops across contacts other devices that should have very low drops. Excessive is often a steady-state condition. Clamp-on power meters are slightly more expensive ($300–$3,000) but used similarly. Though only single-phase, they can useful for current imbalance and power factor, and many have limited harmonic measuring capabilities. Be wary of the 3 assumptions some meters make, which contend that all three phases are identical and, therefore, give you three-phase with a multiplication. Also, most clamp-on meters use transformers that cannot measure (or tolerate) direct current (DC). Power generally have capabilities similar to power meters but can take unattended readings for extended periods. They are useful for finding time-correlated problems, such as the voltage drops at a certain time each day. Several manufacturers offer both single- and three-phase loggers ($500–$3,500) come with software for downloading the data onto a computer for analysis. Some plug right an outlet to let you piggyback the equipment being monitored for simple and safe connections. Most electrical doing power quality work have several monitors, can monitor wide range of power phenomena. Read the specifications and the user’s guide before taking one out to troubleshoot for a suspected power quality This is especially important when looking for transients and higher order harmonics. If the sampling rate the instrument is 64 times per cycle, it is not possible to determine harmonics above the 32nd, and even that is suspect in the real world of measuring. If the current probe is a Rogowski coil (flex-probes) and you are measuring in a room with a half dozen 500-horsepower running off adjustable speed drives, much of the current data is going to be by the antenna-like pickup characteristic of those probes. If using a current isn’t for DC and there is an inrush current condition on a saturated transformer with a DC offset, it won’t produce reliable data. However, using the instrument within its limitations provides a wealth of data that virtually no other instrument can simultaneously do you. Right the sweet spot of power quality monitors are capturing the waveforms of disturbances, such as the transients that before the voltage sag cleared by the distribution circuit protection device or the slight frequency and phase shift that occurs when switching from utility power a backup power source that resulted a particularly susceptible piece equipment dropping off line. Whether doing a benchmark survey to compare site data to the commissioning data or troubleshooting a process interruption that only occurs once per month but with large financial consequences, a power quality monitor in the $3,000–8,000 price range can do exactly that. Though they don’t have the same capture characterization functionality as a power quality monitor, a high-speed (200 megahertz–1 GHz) digital oscilloscope ($3,000–5,000) can be a valuable tool to have at your disposal when looking at noise or transients that are above the bandwidth quality monitors. Likewise, a spectrum analyzer ($10,000–15,000) can provide a more and wider picture of the steady-state signals that are present a system and fall the fundamental frequency or above the harmonic range of most power quality analyzers.

Linguistic Background The languages that spoken in the Pacific region can be divided broadly into groups: the Guinean languages formed by people who participated in earliest migrations over a period of 20,000-30,000 years starting several tens of thousands of years ago, the Austronesian languages spoken by Mongoloid people who migrated from the Asian continent around 3,000 B.C. The region has numerous languages, including 250 Aboriginal languages in Australia and Papuan languages on the island of New Guinea (including Indonesian territory of Irian Jaya) and neighboring areas. are also 350 Austronesian languages in Melanesia, 20 in 12 in and 100 in New Guinea (Comrie, Matthews, Polinsky 1996). There is wide variation not only among language groups, but also among the families of languages. Few language families have been identified among the languages of Australia and New Guinea using the methods of comparative linguistics. languages are also characterized by the small size of speaker populations and by the absence of dominant languages. However, there are usually bilingual people who can speak or at least understand languages of neighboring populations, and it is believed that this situation has existed for a long time. In terms of factors, it appears that the diversification of languages in the Pacific region by the emblematic function of language in the creation of a clear distinction between “ingroup” and “outgroup.” The of New Guinea and the region around it diverse linkages and wide variations between languages. The Austronesian languages the Pacific region are mostly classified as Oceanian languages, while the and Palau of Micronesia are classified into the languages of Western Malaya and Polynesia (WMP, Indonesian family), and the indigenous languages Maluku Irian Jaya in Eastern Indonesia into the (CMP) or the South Halmahera-West New Guinea (SHWNG) subgroups. In particular, there are strong similarities between the characteristics of the CMP and SHWNG languages and those the Melanesian of the Oceanian languages. These linguistic conditions characteristics are attributable to ethnic migrations within the region over long period time, accompanied by contacts and linguistic merging with indigenous Papuan people. Papuan languages are still found in parts of Indonesia, including Northern Halmahera and the islands Pantar and Alor and central eastern Timor the Province of Nusa Tenggara. In New Guinea, contact with languages has caused some Austronesian languages to exhibit a word order from subject-verb-object to subject-object-verb (Austronesian Type 2) (Sakiyama 1994). 2. Linguistic Strata With the of colonization by the European powers in the nineteenth century, a new set of linguistic circumstances developed in region. First, pidgin based on European and Melanesian languages gradually emerged as common languages. The establishment of plantations in Samoa and Queensland, Australia, which had concentrations of people who spoke Melanesian languages, was important in breeding grounds for pidgin languages. A pidgin language is formed from elements of the grammar of both languages, though the pidgin languages tend to be looked down upon from the perspective of the more dominant of the two parent languages. The region’s newly formed common languages, including Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Solomon Pidgin, flourished after they were back to the homelands of the various speakers. This was possible because Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea were all multilingual societies without dominant languages. The number of speakers of pidgin languages increased in this environment. At the same time, continuing existence of ethnic languages came under threat. Examples of pidgins that were creolized (adopted as mother in their own right) include Solomon Pijin, which eventually had speakers aged five and over (1976) in the Solomon Islands. Bislama, a mixture of over 100 indigenous languages grafted upon a base of English and is now spoken by almost the entire population of Vanuatu (170,000 in 1996) and is partially creolized. Of particular interest is the fact a group of more than 1,000 people who emigrated New Caledonia have adopted as their primary language. The situation in Papua New Guinea, which has a population of 4,300,000 is even more dramatic. By 1982 the number of people using Tok Pisin as their primary language had reached 50,000, while another used it as a second language (Grimes 1996). 3.

The expert consensus is that fundamental shift must begin immediately and be well underway the next ten years in order to avert the worst impacts. What is needed is a complete transformation of the way we produce, consume and distribute energy, while at the same time maintaining economic growth. Nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit global warming to less than a rise in temperature of 2° Celsius, above which the impacts become devastating. Current generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary energy. More energy is lost the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately to disruption: technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever is used generate within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, these problems. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a in the that energy is both produced and distributed. 4.1 key principles the energy [r]evolution can be by adhering to five key principles: 1.respect natural limits – phase out fossil fuels by the of this century We must respect natural There is only so much carbon that the can absorb. Each year humans emit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literally filling up the sky. resources of coal could provide several hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keep within safe limits. Oil and coal development must ended. The global Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to reduce energy related CO2 emissions to a maximum of 10 Gigatonnes (Gt) by 2050 and phase fossil fuels by 2.equity and As long as there are natural limits there needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs within societies, between nations and between present and future At extreme, a third of the world’s population no access to electricity, whilst the most industrialised countries consume much more than their The effects of climate change on poorest communities are exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are to address climate change, one of the core principles must be equity and fairness, so that benefits of energy services such as light, heat, and transport – are available for all: north and south, rich and poor. Only in this can we create energy as as the conditions for genuine wellbeing. Advanced Energy [R]evolution has target to achieve energy equity as soon as possible. By 2050 the average per capita emission should be between 1 and 2 of CO2. 3.implement clean, renewable solutions and decentralise energy systems. There no energy shortage. we to do use existing technologies to harness energy effectively and efficiently. Renewable energy energy efficiency measures are ready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and energy technologies have experienced double digit market growth for the decade. Just as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector. Sustainable decentralised energy produce less carbon emissions, are cheaper and involve dependence on imported fuel. They create more jobs and empower local communities. Decentralised systems are more secure and more efficient. This is what the [R]evolution must aim to create. To stop earth’s climate spinning out of control, most of the world’s fossil fuel – coal, oil and gas must remain in the ground. Our goal is for humans to live the natural of small planet. 4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed countries, economic growth must be fully decoupled from fossil fuel usage. It is to suggest that economic growth must be predicated on their increased combustion. to use the energy we produce more efficiently, and we need to make the transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth. 5.phase dirty, unsustainable energyWe to phase out coal and nuclear power.

And we cannot continue to fuel the myriad nuclear threats by nuclear power can any way to combat climate change. There is no role for nuclear power in the [R]evolution.",

The findings are published September 18 in the open-access PLoS Pathogens. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 53 percent of women and 14 percent of men at once in their lives. infections lead to work time and 6.8 medical provider's office visits, million emergency room visits 245,000 hospitalizations a year, with an annual cost of billion in the United States. To help combat this common health issue, the U-M scientists used a novel systematic approach, combining bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics, to look for key of the bacterium, Escherichia coli, that could be in a vaccine to elicit an effective immune response. The team, led Dr. Harry Mobley, Ph.D., screened 5,379 possible bacterial proteins and identified three strong candidates to use in a vaccine to prime the body to E. coli, the cause of most uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The vaccine prevented infection produced key types of immunity when in mice. Scientists attempted develop a vaccine for UTIs over the past two decades.

The rationale that the historic “warrior”, in order succeed in the environment of the time, had a need to cycle between undereating the day (when activity and danger were always present), overeating night (when able to rest and eat a good daily meal). Modern humans in a changed environment can therefore restore health and fitness, by returning to that cycle with the Warrior Warrior Diet grounding The nervous system is the primary focus here, specifically that called the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Body organs such as the heart, and intestines (viscera), and muscles within these organs and other areas like blood vessels, skin, eyes, as well as the glands of the body, are regulated by the ANS. We are mostly unaware of its workings; for example, when blood vessels change size or heart beats faster, these functions are involuntary and reflexive in nature. The ANS has 3 parts - - The sympathetic nervous (SNS) which kicks in when emergencies occur, causing stress and requiring us to “fight” or take “flight” (flee) - The nervous system (PSNS) which operates in normal or nonemergency times, allowing us to “rest” and - The enteric nervous (ENS), present in all vertebrates, which regulates the normal digestive the digestive system and prepares it for whatever is coming, whether a meal or a frantic physical activity The undereating phase of the Warrior Diet is supposed and alert the to potential stress, resulting in the of energy and ultimately the of fat. While undereating, the body is forced to use fat storage as source of fuel for maximum metabolic efficiency – thus promoting weight-loss. The overeating phase Diet recognizes the role of the PSNS in regulating digestion, elimination and metabolic activities that slow you down. during the day stops this process blocks the body’s ability to remove toxins and waste from the body.

But in looking at its origin in 1830 by a called the First Located School Society, found ourselves wandering back to 17th-century England, when the king granted his Connecticut colony a hefty slice of North America. We then jumped ahead a century to see Connecticut give almost all of it away to Revolutionary War debts and settle a shooting war with Connecticut's consolation prize was an isolated fragment of its former colonial estate holdings, more than five hundred miles of Hartford. You've probably heard of Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, but you probably didn't know that it's named the above-noted remnant of legacy from Charles which became known as the Reserve. Three million acres all told, it extended south the 41st parallel from the shores of Erie and west from the newly drawn western border of Pennsylvania. You it today as northern Ohio. lost a bunch of land but still owned a big piece of Ohio. Impressive! But what about the Located School and the East Cemetery? Bear with me. After the Revolutionary a few Connecticut tried to make a go of it in the Western Reserve, but weather, lack of supply and agricultural routes, and less-than-welcoming Indians made things very difficult. Connecticut, perhaps for lack of a better idea the Western Reserve, decided to sell it. In 1795, a group of private investors picked it up for $1.2 million, or 40 cents an acre. The investors sent a guy named Moses Cleaveland to survey the area, and he to have the city, a spelling change, named after him. Connecticut relinquished legal authority the Western a few years later, and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory. Hey, could owned Cleveland! This is where the First School Society in. But explain why there's one county several townships in Ohio named after Fairfield. As the 19th century the Indian threat passed, and supply routes improved. More and Connecticut families emigrated the Western Reserve to get cheap, fertile and live alongside like-minded Englanders. The settlers naturally named their new towns after their old ones, so Fairfield and other Connecticut towns are well represented in Ohio. The westernmost 500,000 acres of the Western Reserve, known as the Firelands, had ago been set aside for residents of eight Connecticut towns, Fairfield, who suffered the loss of their homes to the British in the Revolutionary Affected families were to receive individual land grants, but bureaucracy, Indians, and the War of 1812 killed the well-intentioned project. Finally, we can finish the story of the East Cemetery. What did Connecticut do with that $1.2 million windfall from the 1795 sale of the Western Reserve? The legislature nobly a Perpetual School Fund, to be administered by the towns through civil authorities called societies, now extinct as public education evolved. The inaugural meeting of the First Located School Society of Fairfield took place on Oct. 27, 1796, \"In form and Organize themselves in a School Society according to one Statute Law of this State.\" The Society immediately laid out six school districts. is how the first district was described, exactly as recorded the original record \"Voted and Agreed that the District for a School in this Society -- to begin at Rock a little Easterly of John Wheeler's house, and to run Northwardly of Wheeler's house -- and from thence to run down to the River Eastward to Grovers -- and from thence running up the Harbour as far as to the first Set out, -- all the Inhabitants contained within said to one District for a School in said Society, and to be called by the name of the Rock District.\" Five more districts similarly defined, with boundaries that worked well for 1796 Fairfielders, might be a little shaky these days. In in concert with other Connecticut societies, the First Located Society took on the task of establishing burial ground, for the \"better accommodation of Inhabitants ...\" It seems that this was an obligation legislated by the state, why cemeteries fall the school societies is a mystery. A committee identified a of land in the center of town owned by Mrs. Sarah Taylor, it for $600, dubbed it the East Cemetery, and launched itself into the business.

Since mid-February, over 100 birds have died on this island and tests confirmed H5N1 infection. Also in Asia, cats and other felidae have been occasionally found to be infected with H5N1 since start of the poultry epidemic in 2003. studies have shown that the domestic cat can become infected with the and that cat cat transmission is possible in principle. The virus causes respiratory disease which can lead to death in cat species. Serological studies in several Asian countries suggest that dogs may also contract the H5N1 infection. Countries in have advised owners of pets living near H5N1 wild bird foci keep cats indoors and dogs on leash when for a walk. These recent events lead to many questions by the public and pet owners to which the veterinary profession has to respond. there may exposure of pet owners and veterinarians. For example, when animals infected H5N1 (eg birds, dogs cats) are brought to the veterinary clinic. Important are the contribution veterinary practitioners can make in the surveillance of disease for the presence of the H5N1 infection. This section provides information for the general and professionals the risk of cats contracting H5N1 virus and the role cats in the spread of avian influenza H5N1. During a H5N1 outbreak in poultry in 1997 Hong Kong, the first clinical human cases of this were reported with several fatalities.

However, it is unlikely that cats a role in the natural transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. Cat infections occasionally occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild e.g. when feed on infected birds.

Naturally infected cats are in theory, able to spread the virus. areas where H5N1 Infected wild birds are reported it be that cats become infected. Although most wild birds infected waterfowl, not the species cats interact with, potentially infectious to numerous other bird species and it can not be ruled that passerines or pigeons which do interact with cats get infected. In areas where poultry infected with H5N1 there is a risk that cats become infected with H5N1 through contact infected poultry or their faeces. Anecdotal reports support notion tha",

Both and women smallholders and poor farmers have frequently been cut off from these essential agricultural support systems, which seldom take into account the different responsibilities and men and farmers. In spite of their enormous and their crucial roles in agricultural production, women in particular have insufficient access to production inputs and support This trend underlines the need to implement measures aimed enhancing the access of small farmers, especially women, to production inputs - particularly since the working of development organizations changed as a result of market liberalization and a role for the worldwide. National agricultural extension systems are no exception to this rule, and must respond by making and external adjustments. attention is so that the adjustments do not detrimental to women and men small farmers. For example, field experiences the last decade have pointed the need for extension that are more strategically planned, needs-based, participatory and problem solving. Women's access to and use support is also severely limited the heavy burden on time and energy that results from their triple responsibilities - productive activities (such as in the fields), reproductive (such as child rearing, cooking household chores) community management. In order to improve production, farmers need access to financial capital. Buying seeds, and other agricultural inputs often requires short-term loans, which are repaid when are harvested. Installing major improvements, such as irrigation pumps, or acquiring new technology that increases future is without access to long-term credit. Smallholders, particularly women, often face difficulties in credit. This is a direct consequence of their access to land, participation development projects and extension programmes and membership in rural organizations, all of which are important channels for obtaining loans and credit information. In several countries sub-Saharan Africa, where farmers are roughly equal in number, it is estimated that women farmers receive only percent of the loans granted to smallholders and less than 1 percent of the total credit advanced to the agriculture sector. Credit delivery can be improved by up microfinance institutions in rural areas and the banking system to cater to the needs of small farmers, especially women. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which first pioneered the microcredit approach in reaches more than 2 million people. Since it was founded, the bank has lent more than most of it in the form of loans of a few hundred dollars for small agriculture, distribution, crafts and trading enterprises. Numerous studies shown that women are generally more and punctual in repaying their loans than men are. A programme providing credit and nutrition for women improved both the participating women's incomes and children's nutritional status. This is conclusion of a study that examined the impact a and education programme run by the NGO from Hunger. Men and women smallholders suffer financially from limited access marketing that would allow to turn surplus produce into cash income. Women face difficulties because marketing infrastructure and organizations are rarely geared towards either small-scale producers or the crops that grow. Although women all over the world are active as traders, hawkers and street and market vendors, little has been done improve transport and market facilities to support this vital economic sector. Even where women an important role in wholesale trade, their full membership in marketing service institutions is still because they may be illiterate or lack independent legal status.

Now, since scrap in the manufacturing can be calculated, many manufactures play a form of the “shell If a manufacturer has multiple facilities making that generate scrap which can be reused in the manufacturing processes then, to calculate recycled content, scrap is just between facilities. Now the scrap is claimed to be diverted from landfill and calculated as recycled content. Please that for a recycling program to work, a manufacturer needs a continuous feedstock of waste material, so some of this moving around of scrap is legitimate.

Anabaptists occasionally accepted the comparison (Klassen, William and Walter eds. and trans. The Writings of Marpeck, Classics of the Radical Reformation, vol. 2. Scottdale, PA: Herald Press, 1978: 217) but more frequently rejected it (Klassen Klaassen: 215-16; Menno, Writings, 369, 401), in part because monks often came from socially privileged classes. Several scholars have used monastic history as an aid to interpret Anabaptism (Troeltsch, Ritschl, Davis, Snyder, Martin). Many Anabaptists and Mennonites, beginning with the Hutterite pointed to quasi-monastic sectarian medieval movements, especially Waldenses, as forerunners of Anabaptism (these theories promulgated or discussed by Keller, Gratz, Verduin, One of the most extensive efforts to relate monasticism and Anabaptism drew both and quasi-monastic traditions (Davis). Most scholars have carefully limited their interpretations to pointing out \"intellectual parallels\" or general similarities; some have argued direct continuity and influence. The crucial interpretive question revolves around the nature of is it a nonconforming sectarian critical of the institutional church (Workman) or an intensified institutional of the ecclesiastical establishment? Or, did monasticism begin as charismatic, lay, \"sectarian\" in the century but become fully integrated into the sacramental, ecclesial, institutional church by the early Middle Ages (Rousseau, Martin)? How central the critical, separatist aspect of early monasticism is to monastic identity is disputed, even by those within the community (Eoin de Bhaldraithe). Particularly significant in this regard is distinction between contemplative monastic (Benedictine, Carthusian) more lay-oriented, urban mendicant orders and houses regular canons of the Middle Ages (Franciscans, Augustinian Friars, Praemonstratensians, Augustinian Canons). The latter orders were associated with the class and were visibly and pastorally active; the former were often but not associated with the nobility and lived in secluded and rural areas. Most Anabaptist links to to have been with mendicants and canons regular. Michael Sattler is the exception to this generalization. Most agree that Anabaptists rejected the sacramental and institutional \"culture-church\" of the Middle Ages in favor of a voluntary, non-institutionalized, even anti-clerical church of the faithful few, in effect, reducing the church to a devout \"monastic\" core. At issue among scholars is whether the label \"monastic\" should properly be applied to sectarian, pure church vision as that held Anabaptists, since most monks did not believe that church was made up solely of monastics, rather, they believed that monks and nuns were part, perhaps the most important of the church. The qualities and virtues prized by Anabaptists and Mennonites (hospitality, humility, community, Gelassenheit, obedience, repentance, nonresistance, etc.) were also prime monastic virtues, although all medieval Catholics were exhorted to practice these same virtues. parallels to monastic spirituality are found in the Mennonite period of post-Anabaptist history in which Anabaptist first-generation identity was transformed into a sacramental, ecclesial, institutional, cultural (ethnic) faith, even though Mennonites, Amish, and Hutterites avoided the language of sacramental and institutional Christianity (Cronk, Martin). During the 1980s growing about the role of single adults in the church has not yet taken account of the traditional Christian monastic theology, with its implications for marriage and singleness. Recent scholarship on monasticism emphasizes social role of celibate communities, which enhanced the role of marriage while creating a sphere of activity for those remaining unmarried (Brown, Leclercq). research all these areas of Anabaptist and history and Cronk, Sandra. \"Gelassenheit: The Rites of the Redemptive Process in Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite Communities.\" PhD dissertation, U. of Chicago, 1977.

It had its origin in a \"General Conference of Mennonites France in Reconstruction Work\" at Clermont-en-Argonne, Meuse, France, 20-22 June 1919. This was organized on an intended permanent basis with a constitution whose name tentatively chosen as People's Movement,\" and which was to meet annually. Its clearly purpose was constructive and progressive, and its three annual conference programs represented in a Christian Life with accent problems of youth. The movement also represented dissatisfaction with the rather general church leadership and program, and also determination to work out a and more place for the more mature young people the work and leadership of the church. Since much of older leadership of the church reacted with skepticism and even suspicion to the new movement, opposition and tension developed. Differences were sorted out in the end and the movement got started in America, its name to the People's Conference. Three annual meetings were held: West Liberty, Ohio, 28-30 August 1920; Sterling, IL, 15-18 June 1922; Middlebury, IN (Forks church), 14-17 June General tensions in the this time, resulting in the closing of Goshen for the year 1923-24 and divisions in a of congregations in Indiana, Ohio, Ontario, and Eastern Pennsylvania, led to in the ranks of leadership of the Young People's Conference, and ultimately to the the annual meetings. The committee in charge for the 1923 conference listed Harold S. Bender, chairman; Walter E. Yoder, secretary; John Yoder, treasurer; Miller, and Vernon Smucker.

To be strict or not to be strict, that is the question fact, it’s the number-one question among child-rearing and education authorities, among teachers of parents. It’s doubtful that there is a parent who hasn’t time or another agonized over this. is a widespread uncertainty on how be at home (or how to come across in the classroom) – tough or soft, to strict disciplinarian or a permissivist. Have you noticed, however, that you seldom hear a parent or teacher admit “I am authoritarian” or “I am permissive”? These are terms reserved for those with whom you disagree. The question, whether to strict or lenient, never ceases to debated in books and articles, or at conferences and conventions. Dr. Gordon points this question is what social scientists call a “pseudo problem” and how it also is a clear of “either-or thinking”. Let’s take a look what means by that. Seldom parents or teachers seem recognize that it is not necessary to make a choice between these two leadership styles. Few adults it, but is an alternative to at either end of the strictness-leniency scale. There is the choice a style. This alternative is being neither authoritarian nor permissive, neither strict nor lenient. Does mean being somewhere near the middle of the scale–moderately strict or moderately lenient? Not at all. The alternative is not being on the scale at all! How so? Authoritarian leadership–whether at home or in classroom–means that the control is in the hands of adult leader. It has been researched and proven for decades how ineffective maintaining control through power is. Authoritarianism often creates fearful and subservient children and/or rebellion. Still, no parent or teacher really wants to suffer the chaotic consequences of unrestricted freedom and lawless permissiveness either. It’s also true that most are uncomfortable with the consequences of permissiveness. Permissive leadership means that control “permitted” to be in the hands of the youngsters. Children of permissive parents usually feel guilty about always getting their way. They also feel insecure about being loved, because inconsiderate behaviors make them feel unlovable. So what is third viable alternative to authoritarian and permissive adult leadership? It’s what in detail describes in model of parenting, a set of skills and methods known as Parent Effectiveness Training that are geared toward rearing self-disciplined in a harmonious family climate.

In tests, the new Advanced Spectroscopic monitors, or ASPs, \"led to the determination that additional functional capacity is needed meet the operational standards,\" a department spokeswoman announced. announcement, which means the machines could another year reach U.S. ports, comes after more than a year of sparring between officials and the Government Accountability Office over how effective the technology is as well as testing methods used to evaluate it. The debate over the new equipment largely played out in congressional hearings. In September, Government Accountability Office officials argued that DHS testing was based on a \"biased\" methodology that allowed an artificial edge during the evaluation of their radiation detectors, an allegation Homeland Security officials said was off base. Officials at the Belgian port of Antwerp, however, are moving ahead with deployment the ASPs use in screening. \"We're in the process of finalizing it Pascal Fias, a scientist at the Antwerp port, said last week during an Atomic Energy Agency-sponsored conference on trafficking here. In Netherlands, customs are already using the ASP in secondary deployments and expect to eventually use them as primary scanners, Fias said. Containers at ports are through two-phase scanning process. During the first the shipping containers are sent through very sensitive detectors plastic scintillators. Plastic scintillators can detect very low-level radiation emissions but are incapable of identifying isotope emitting the Due to their sensitivity, they can be triggered by innocuous cargo with levels of natural like kitty litter or bananas. In one instance a load of blueberries off Belgian alarms. The fruit exhibited trace of cesium contamination, a legacy from Chernobyl, Fias said. If the primary detectors discover presence of radiation, the shipping container is sent a secondary screening customs officials use hand-held devices to determine the nature of the source. After the latest round of GAO criticism of the DHS technology vetting process, Homeland Security suggested the ASP detectors would first be deployed in secondary locations and testing would continue before replacing the plastic scintillators. While port officials have no plans to shift the ASP to a primary detection deployment - they say they have the plastic scintillators and might as well use them - the new technology is perfect for secondary screening, they \"For the second phase, it makes a lot of sense to use the ASP,\" Fias told Global Security Newswire, calling the technology best on the market.\" Without the ASP detectors, custom officials must use a small, hand-held scanner to assess the entire shipping container. That is a small large box, a combination that has led complaints from customs at the port, Fias said. By contrast, the ASP are \"basically a very, very big detector that can scan the of the he said. primary scanners with the technology requires any new device to be at least a sensitive as the plastic scintillators, Fias notes, a more challenging bar to meet. The goal these both domestically and abroad, is not necessarily increasing level or radiation ports, but rather smoothing the flow of commerce and sure detection regime is not disruptive. U.S. officials have repeatedly said the goal is to lower the number of false alarms at large ports as Los Angeles/Long Beach. That port, the nation's busiest, has about 500 radiation alerts a day, and DHS officials suggest the new technology could plunge that number to less than 30. \"We want have low economic impact.

There are basically three methods of treating fire ants. The way to broadcast fire ant bait such as Amdro, Logic, and several other brands on and around the mound while the ants are foraging. The ants think the bait is food when it actually is a poison. It goes down to the queen and gets rid of the colony over time. The second method is to treat the mounds with an insecticide drench, such as acephate, carbaryl (Sevin) and several others. The drenches use a small amount of the active poison ingredient mixed with water and poured upon the mound.

Our abilities to learn and remember are to our sense of self and our ability to function effectively in daily life. Memory is glue that holds our mental life together. As a result, we are who in large part of what we have learned and what we remember from past experience. But what is memory? How does the brain and sustain it? Why memory sometimes fail us? Those simple questions, of course, have exceedingly complex answers, and many biological details about the process of memory in humans and other animals remain unknown. Eric Kandel of Columbia University, however, has provided a good start. His studies of the molecular basis of learning and memory underpin much of what know about how events recorded by the brain, processed individual nerve cells, etched in gray matter. For work learning and memory, Kandel was awarded a share of the 2000 Nobel in Physiology or Medicine. In the Kandel began his studies of learning and memory focusing on of the sea slug which he found to be marvelously tractable system in which to study the cellular basis these abilities. With only about 20,000 cells — compared with the roughly thousand billion in humans — and a well-delineated neural circuitry, it proved possible to zero in on biologically interesting reflex pathway. Like humans and other animals, Aplysia is capable of learning to modify this reflex, and this learning involves making memories. that the cellular basis for memory depends persistent changes in synapses, the connections between nerve cells. The differences in the strength of these connections come about through Kandel found that when, in the withdrawal reflex, the gill reacts to touch, the connection between sensory nerve cell and motor cell of the reflex activated. When the sea slug was taught ignore a harmless connections between the sensory nerve and motor cell weakened. When the same light was to an unpleasant stimulus the animal became sensitized. would now react strongly to the light touch because the same set connections had strengthened. Kandel later that short-term memory is kindled by the modulation of synapses and long-term memory is sustained by the activation of genes. The formation of determined, is a function of biochemical changes that occur at the synapse. make short-term memories, the involved in a chain of events at of nerve cells are chemically altered by the addition of phosphate groups. To cement a memory for the long haul, proteins are added synapse to make new with sensitization and lose connections with habituation. In the 1990s, he turned from simple forms of learning to more complex using mice and showed that similar principles for short and long term were at work here as well. By laying a for understanding the events shape our ability to learn and remember, Kandel's work has helped us understand not only the cellular processes that occur during the of learning and remembering, also - through his work on - where things can go wrong when dementia and other illnesses that affect memory arise. The cellular processes by Kandel are the targets of drugs used to these disorders of memory. Pinpointing the activity of individual nerve cells engaged the process of learning and memory may help in the development of new, more effective agents treat diseases that affect brain.

Interestingly, none of the states has broken individual maximum highs, at least the data January 6, underscoring how large in size the overall weather pattern is. The weather bureau's manager for climate monitoring, Karl Braganza on Monday described the event as a \"dome of heat\" over continent. NSW, which is to endure extreme temperatures today, has to exceed 44.1 degrees on average to beat the record set on January 14, 1939.

This is helpful,as the wide variety shading options currently available can make choosing an effective solar load control strategy confusing Snapshots of Shading Options,HE Sept/Oct '00,p.20). The prototype house was built in 1998 Tucson, Arizona, as Department of Energy's Building America program.Its integrated package of energy-saving features includes insulated panels (SIPs) for the wall and roof coating on the roof, spectrally selective windows, architectural shading, an interior location for the air handler ducts, highefficiency air conditioning equipment, solar water heating. Building America (see Clean Breathing in 29) works with five building industry teams to produce residential buildings on a community scale. Systems incorporated into these houses are evaluated conducting successive design, test, redesign,and retest iterations until cost and performance trade-offs yield innovations that can be cost effectively implemented in production-scale housing.RGC CourtHomes,Inc., built the prototype, input from the IBACOS Building America Consortium. Building performance was modeled using a detailed hourly energy simulation tool and was measured while the building was unoccupied for a period of 12 days. inputs included direct measurements of the net air exchange rate, surface reflectance,and transmittance.

Typical new productionscale houses in the market are framed on a slabon- grade foundation stucco exterior finish and a sloped concrete tile or flat built-up bituminous roof. These standard-practice houses are built using standard construction materials and techniques, nominal 2 x 4 wood framing,fiberglass batt insulation,1-inch polystyrene sheathing,and double- pane,clear-glass,aluminum frame windows. The slab foundation has no insulation,and the attic is usually vented. A forcedair distribution system provides space heating and cooling,with the air handler located in the garage and the flex duct in the attic. This system is typically supplied by a 10-SEER air conditioner and an 80% annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) furnace. The prototype house differs from these houses in several It has a airtight envelope, with minimized air distribution losses. The house's energy-saving plus the large ratio of window to the design, render window contributions more important than they are in conventional housing, particularly in the Tucson climate. The prototype incorporates several reengineered features into its structural and equipment systems (see Table 1). Envelope changes include a sealed, insulated, and conditioned crawlspace foundation (a shallow basement) and SIPs (see SIPs Face the Skeptics,HE,Mar/Apr '98). The foundation stem walls are 6-inchthick reinforced concrete, insulated the interior with 2-inch-thick rigid foam board (R-10) that serves the concrete form.

Veins are the blood vessels that return to the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the of the body. Varicose veins most commonly occur in the legs. In about 50% of cases, the condition runs in families, and probably is related to an inherited weakness in the veins' walls or valves inside veins that keep blood from backing up. Pregnancy is common cause of veins. During volume of blood increases veins to expand. Also, occupations require uninterrupted standing and nurses, mothers with young children) force leg veins and valves to work against gravity for hours, increasing the risk of pressure-related vein and valve damage. Garters also can increase the risk of varicose veins if their elastics slow blood flow in the legs. Varicose are 2 to 3 times more common in than men. Obese people are more likely to develop varicose veins. Varicose veins can be associated with blood clots and damage to the deeper veins in one or both legs, a that sometimes can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. this happens, the veins lose their ability to effectively move blood back to the heart. This can cause significant leg swelling and skin sores or ulcers. In the legs, varicose veins commonly are found along the inside the leg, at the ankles and at the back of the The veins look blue, swollen or stretched out, kinked or twisted. In some people, varicose veins do not cause any symptoms. other people may experience one or more of the following: - A dull ache in the legs - A feeling of pressure or heaviness in the legs - Swollen feet and ankles Itching skin the damaged veins In severe cases of chronic venous insufficiency, a slowing of blood flow through the vein can lead to skin changes, including dryness, a rash or brownish discoloration and open sores (ulcers). Slow blood flow also can cause a clot to inside the vein. This condition is called thrombosis. In general, of varicose veins are worse at the end of the day, especially periods of prolonged standing. Some also find that symptoms are more intense during the days before their menstrual periods, and during pregnancy. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and about your family of varicose veins. He or she also will ask about lifestyle, the number of hours that you spend on your feet. In women, your doctor will ask about your pregnancy history about the tightness of elastics on the socks or stockings you wear. Your doctor can diagnose veins with a simple physical In most cases, no special tests are necessary. veins are a long-term problem, but symptoms can come and go. If you are pregnant and experiencing problems with varicose veins, your symptoms will improve after delivery. your varicose veins probably will disappear totally, and you can expect symptoms to return during future pregnancies. You can help to prevent varicose veins maintaining a normal weight and by situations where you stand for prolonged periods. Even with these preventive measures, however, you still may develop varicose veins condition tends to run in family. If you already have varicose veins, you can prevent symptom flare-ups by periodically lying down or sitting down with your legs elevated above the level of your chest. Some physicians also recommend that you wear support stockings or more specialized compression stockings when you walk or stand for long periods of time. The stockings prevent blood from in the veins, and prevent strain on the valves and leg swelling. Treatment for most people with mild symptoms of varicose veins includes: - Elevating and supporting the legs periodically throughout the - Wearing compression stockings varicose veins that close to the skin, dermatologists or vascular surgeons may offer sclerotherapy laser therapy.

These issues can be especially difficult for teens who are (or think they may be) homosexual. Homosexual teens deserve the same understanding and respect as heterosexual teens, and it is important for everyone to know the facts about homosexuality. Here are the Each of us has a (we have a male or female body), a gender identity (we feel like a male or female), and a sexual orientation (we are attracted to or females). Homosexuality refers to a person's sexual orientation; homosexual teen-agers have strong romantic or sexual feelings for a person of the sex. Heterosexual teen-agers are attracted people of the opposite sex, and bisexual teens are attracted to people of both sexes. The word \"gay\" used describe both men and women who are with the word \"lesbian\" specifically to a woman. It is estimated that 10 of the population in the United and throughout the world is lesbian or gay. Although scientists don't know why some people are and others are not, most believe that homosexuality is a normal variation of sexual orientation. may be genetic, result natural substances (hormones) in the body, be influenced by the environment before or after most likely, several of these things working in combination. Homosexual teens are found in all types of families. Homosexuality is not caused by \"bad parenting.\" If teen is gay, it is not because of anything you or anyone else did. Homosexuality also is not something a person chooses, nor is an illness that can be cured. According to the American Psychiatric Association, so-called therapies such as \"reparative and \"transformational ministry\" don't work and can be causing guilt and anxiety in homosexual teens. Not all teen-agers who are attracted to members of the same sex are homosexual. Many teens experiment with their sexuality during adolescence, in the same way that they experiment with body art or music. This brief sexual experimentation thought to be a normal of sexual development. For homosexual the attraction to people of the same sex is stronger and longer lasting. to top Every family is different. While one parent may out by chance that a teen is homosexual, may hear from their teen in person, in a letter or by a phone call. When a teen tells other people that he is homosexual, it's called \"coming out.\" this process sometimes can be difficult or painful for families, it also can be a time of tremendous growth. It is important to remember that all teens need their family's support and acceptance, especially when they are with sensitive issues. Back to top \"Coming out\" can scary and painful, and parents need to reassure their children that they will be loved any less for sharing the truth about themselves. If your teen you he is gay, let him know that you love him unconditionally, and accept him no matter what. Show your that you care by learning more about homosexuality. Read on the subject or check out reputable Web (such as www.pflag.org). Talk to adults you who are gay. Look for organizations or support groups in your that can give you information on homosexuality. It will be easier for to support your teen when you know more and are comfortable with the subject. Parents may worry about how friends, neighbors and family will react to their teen's homosexuality. It usually best not to share any information your teen-ager's Unfortunately, prejudice against homosexuals is widespread, mostly due to ignorance fear. When your teen ready for you to let others know, you should talk them about your teen's sexual orientation and help them to by using what you have learned. Back to top Growing up as a homosexual in a mostly heterosexual society often not easy. Gay and lesbian adolescents sometimes must cope with unfair, prejudiced, and violent behavior at at home and in the community. They may feel fear or be alone and unsupported. This can push some teens to use drugs and alcohol, engage in risky sexual behavior, or even attempt It is important that homosexual teens feel supported by their and always able to talk openly with them about these issues.

Shmerling, M.D. Beth Israel Medical Center \"If you take this medication, you reduce your of disease by 20%, and 98% of people taking it have no serious side effects.\" Sounds right? Perhaps not. What if your chance getting disease is one in 1,000 but two people out of every 100 experience a deadly side effect? Talk Risk Doctors, nurses, reporters and advertisers talk though they may not call that. In fact, they often use other terms sound logical and understandable as \"chance\" or \"likelihood\" (as in \"if you smoke, you will increase your chances of having lung disease\"). Alternatively, they couch the terms in personal (as in \"I think medicine help you; it works for most of my Or, the message may be even vague: When a says \"I think this therapy help and I doubt it will cause you any problems,\" the doctor is really saying he or she hopes helps because it usually does, but that there is a that the medication will cause side effects and/or that it will not work. Whether or the word is used, are all examples risk, the notion that might or might not happen and that the likelihood is not zero or 100%. I was taught in medical school to \"never say never and never say always,\" because absolute certainty so rare. Back to top Is Not Simple Risk is a trickier concept than many people think. It may seem like something to avoid at all costs, the is that while you may be able to choose risk over another, you cannot always avoid risk altogether. Avoiding one risk may other risks. example, if you have blood pressure and a doctor prescribes a medication to lower there is a risk of side effects from the medication; but by avoiding the of having a side effect, you increase the risk that you will have stroke due to untreated high blood pressure. Many people view any risk at all as a terrible thing, but it is important to realize that a chance that something will happen, not a certainty. Even when talking about bad outcomes (such as the risk of surgery or risk of medication side effects), is often excellent that nothing bad will happen. Consider this example. For a person suffering chronic arthritis and terrible joint pain for the two symptoms probably will continue unless something changes (such as an effective treatment). The risk of side effects from any medication is clearly but it must be against high risk pain will If out of 100 people taking a high-dose anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen) develop a ulcer each year (that is, if the risk is 3%), it is important to weigh that against the risk of ongoing pain (which much higher). And it also means that 97 out of 100 people will not suffer an ulcer as they enjoy the benefits of the medication. Back to top The Confusing Ways To Describe Risk The other reason risk is confusing is that there are many ways it can be described. People may choose one to describe risk to emphasize how high it is, while others another way to express the same risk downplay it. Remarkably, the same risk can seem quite different depending on how it is expressed. One the most common areas of confusion comes with the difference between absolute risk and relative risk. Imagine that you offered a choice two medications to reduce your of attack: - A will decrease risk of heart attack by 20%. - Medication B your risk from 5% to 4%. If think that Medication A sounds better, you are not alone. risk is described, by comparing the new risk with the risk before treatment. Although vitally important, the actual risk with and without the medicine not for Medication A. If you thought Medication B sounds less impressive, perhaps it's because knowing that the starting and ending risks are similar that is, knowing the actual, or absolute, risks makes the change seem less dramatic. This is true is very low or very in the first place. they provide more assessment of risk, expressions of absolute risk are often missing from news ads. Most of us would think that Medication A is better. But described, Medication A and B be the same Reducing a risk of 5 in 100 to in 100 is to relative risk reduction. So it is not surprising what you usually read in news reports and see in advertisements are changes in relative risk rather the more critical number, the absolute risk. The relative tends to be the larger and more persuasive number. For person or advertiser trying to a dramati",

Birds begin to arrive at the main colony on Torishima Island early October. A single egg is laid in late October to late November and incubation lasts 64 to 65 days. Hatching occurs in late December through January. Chicks begin to fledge in late May into June. There is little information on timing of breeding Minami-kojima. First breeding when birds are five years old, more commonly when birds are aged six. It forages diurnally and potentially either or in groups primarily taking prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009).

The holiness of arises in part from what remains there, but more from what took place there. So it is with its sister cities. Hebron is where the patriarchs and matriarchs lived and are buried, and it was first capital of King David. Tiberias, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, was chosen the patriarch of the Jews in the second century as his seat. The Palestinian Talmud was largely composed in its great rabbinical academy. in the environs of Safed, high in the Galilean hills, the graves of the leading rabbis of antiquity. Its stature a holy city was enhanced in the sixteenth century, when it was the greatest center of Jewish mysticism seat of Jewish legal scholarship.

Drawn and painted in Palestine in the half of the nineteenth it those venues which indicate their holiness. There a suggestion of their geographic positioning, but the \"map\" is far more statement of place these cities hold in Jewish veneration, than of the geographical site occupy. To pious Jewish families, such wall plaques were more meaningful depictions of the Land than the most aesthetically beautiful and topographically exact representations. A small illustrated guide book to the burial places of biblical figures and saintly rabbis in Land, Zikaron Birushalayim, appeared in Constantinople in 1743. tells the pious pilgrim where graves be found and prayers are to be said.

In the pilgrim is not directed to the holy grave sites, but also regaled with wondrous tales. One tells of a sexton of the community sent down to search for a ring which had fallen to depths of patriarchs' burial cave, finding at floor of the cave ancient men seated on chairs, engaged in study. He them; they return greetings, give him the ring, and instruct him to disclose what he had learned. he ascended and was asked what he had seen, he replied: \"Three elders sitting on chairs.

In the concentric circles of holiness cited in the Tanhuma, Jerusalem is at the center of the Holy Land; the Temple at the center of Jerusalem; and the Holy of Holies at the center of the Holy Temple. The Temple is prominently featured in illustrated books about the Holy Land. In A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine, three chapters describe and engravings portray the Temple. Early books quite poor in illustrations, because relatively few deal with that demand presentation. Among these are books dealing with laws concerning the Temple, and since its architecture and vessels pertinent to laws, they invite illustration. A case in point Sefer Hanukat Ha-Bayit by Moses (Hefez) Gentili in Venice in 1696. A treatise on the of Second Temple, it abounds in engraved architectural illustrations, including menorah, seven-branched candlestick; most notable is a large pull-out map of Temple, identifying fifty-eight components of the Temple's structure.

The estate to Malthus, a gentleman of independent means and intellectual philosophers Hume and Rousseau were traveling in the neighborhood, seeking a house for Rousseau, had just recently arrived in England under Hume's patronage after having been out Switzerland. Daniel Malthus was known to both philosophers, at least correspondence, so they paid him a brief visit, in the course of which they his son Thomas, then just three weeks old. So there, presumably in the same room, were Hume, Rousseau, and the infant Thomas Malthus. It was an odd grouping: the serene empiricist, the neurotic social optimist, and the future oracle of demographic doom. Hume had dabbled in himself some years He had been one of the first to argue against belief, common until his that ancient world was more populous than the modern world. Demography, along with its cousin discipline of economics, \"in the air\" during the eighteenth century, for the grown-up Malthus to cast cold eye upon it in his momentous Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). Of these two disciplines, it is a nice point argument which better deserves to be called \"the dismal science.\" I would vote for demography. It hard to maintain a cheerful composure while scrutinizing the ceaseless, often inexplicable ebbs and flows of nativity and mortality. It is a strange thing, too — and a depressing one for anyone of an empirical — that what to be most exact of all the human sciences has such a sorry record of prediction. What, after all, could more certain than that a nation with number N of five-year-olds today will have N fifteen-year-olds in a time, give or take some small margin for attrition and human sciences don't any more precise than that.

The third quarter of the twentieth century dogged by of a catastrophe. Popular fiction echoed those fears in productions like John Brunner's novel Stand on Zanzibar (1968) and Richard Fleischer's movie Soylent Green (1973). It was assumed, reasonably enough, that populous poor countries were most at being closest the limits of food supply. Governments and organizations therefore got to work promoting birth control in what we had just recently learned to call the Third World, with programs that were often coercive. Birth rates soon fell; though how much of the was directly to the programs, and much was an of modernization, is evidence strong that women liberated pre-modern subordination to their husbands, and given easy access to contraception, will limit their pregnancies with without official encouragement. There though, a side of the dropping birthrates. Many countries have a traditional preference male children. So long as women in those countries were resigned to a lifetime of child-bearing, the sheer number of offspring ensured that the sex ratio at birth (SRB) would be to its natural of 105 males to 100 females. The post-natal ratio might be skewed by local traditions of female and by loss of young men in but a rough balance was kept. China in the 1930s had around 108 males per 100 females. Once the limiting births settled in, people that of their babies be male. a mother gives birth twice, there a 24 percent chance neither baby will be male; the chance of no males in three births twelve percent; chance of in four births, six percent. Female infanticide continued to be an option, but not an attractive one — nor, in modern jurisdictions, legal one.

It to two or more entities — usually a school and city or private organization — sharing indoor and spaces like gymnasiums, athletic and playgrounds. The concept is simple: share resources to keep costs down and communities healthy. Examples of joint use agreements: A principal unlocks the school gate after hours so neighbors can or play ball on evenings and weekends. A school and swim team share a pool. school opens its soccer field to a local league for weekend games. A YMCA opens its gym to the local teacher so students have a to exercise. Why is joint needed? The research is clear: the more active are, the healthier they will be now and when they grow up. Yet certain places make physical activity harder instead of easier. Place matters since experts now know that where we live, work and play — the physical itself — determines, a large degree, whether we will be healthy.

Joint use makes physical activity easier by providing kids and adults alike safe, located and inviting places to exercise and making sense from a health joint use agreements make sense because they build upon assets a community already has.

In California, a survey conducted by the Center for Cities Schools revealed that close to 60 percent of responding school already have some type of joint but thousands still not. does it work? Joint use agreements facilitate a partnership between two or more often districts government agencies parks and recreation or nonprofit organizations, to open up spaces such playgrounds, athletic fields, pools, and to the community outside school hours or to open up community facilities to schools at a reduced cost or for free. Joint use partnerships can be formal (based on legal document) or informal (based on a handshake), but formal offer increased protections for both the facility and the community group using the facility. school staffing can change over personal relationships are the most secure way to guarantee access to facilities into the future. A formal agreement can help prevent problems related to maintenance, operations, liability, ownership or cost from arising. Maintenance– How we keep the space in good condition? Joint use agreements can detail each partner’s goals to help ensure that school properties are respected and maintained. school resources are being shared, it’s important to have joint agreements that specify who to make repairs and who will address wear tear to the property. Some school have a in vandalism implementing a joint agreement. have noted that when the community shares school they take pride and ownership in the space, which can help deter vandalism. Operations — Who will unlock the gate? Who run the programs? These questions can be answered with joint use agreements so that know what they are responsible for. Liability–What if someone gets hurt? Experts say most schools’ existing liability insurance is sufficient to cover any liability with joint use. Joint use agreements can identify liability concerns and make sure they are accounted for.

In 2008 Maxwell created a class about the history of rock and roll, teaches about the genre's evolution its relationship to history. \"The cool thing about rock and roll that ties into the American culture and really reflects what's on in the country,\" Maxwell said. \"It serves as the voice of the common person and has been associated with some important historical moments in the U.S. It was a part of that voice in the civil rights movement in the '60s and used in protest of the War in the '70s.\" Rock music's history runs purple, with the color being adopted by some of the most influential musicians. \"Think of the deeper concept of what a song 'Purple Haze' means, especially when it first came out,\" Maxwell said. \"The late was all about looking at things differently. Jimi Hendrix perfectly captured that era in the country, that time of opening the of perception in mind and looking at something on a deeper level.\" He said the Hendrix is referring to is that unknown, almost analogous way of thinking. \"Metaphorically, purple was a blend between the standardized 'primary colors' introduced by mainstream society in the 1950s and mid-1960s,\" Maxwell said. Other artists, such as Deep Purple and Prince, adopted the color because of its ambiguity in musical soundscape and pop culture. Deep Purple one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, said. The was the first rock band to record with a full Concerto orchestra, as well the first to turn the to 11, a feat earning them title of the world's loudest band by the Guinness Book of World Records in And then the song \"Smoke the Water.\" that song came out it was such a fresh thing,\" Maxwell said. \"No longer was the focus just on the That riff made the as important as the words. Today most people don't remember the lyrics they that guitar lick.\" In 1984 released \"Purple Rain,\" an album that took the newly introduced music video to the next level as a full-length film. The album also introduced Prince's backing band. The an apt title due to the soundtrack's nature, said. album has since been seen as an avant-garde piece of work and has been one the greatest albums of all time outlets like Time magazine, Rolling Stone, VH1 and others. \"Purple's taking the softness of blue, the loudness and meeting in the middle to make things a little It's a blend of those two primary colors and is a different way of looking at things,\" he said.",

In the meantime, I called several universities with large aerospace programs, and if there had the answer. Nope. Nada. Nothing. So this is beginning to bug me.

In the 1990s, however, the first a new class of treatment options emerged for Crohn's disease. Referred to as biologic response modifiers, agents, or simply these drugs specific parts of an immune system reduce inflammation. Biologics not only relieve Crohn's symptoms but also can bring about remission and keep you in remission. They are indicated use when someone has moderately to active Crohn’s disease and has not responded well to other Crohn’s disease treatments. Many people with Crohn's now live with significantly fewer but worry about side effects. Here's look at the risks and benefits of In Crohn's disease, an immune system causes inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. Made from living organisms, biologics work just like substances made by the immune system and can control the immune response. Four are FDA approved for Three of the four block a called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that's involved inflammation. These drugs are often called anti-TNF drugs or inhibitors. They Cimzia (certolizumab), Humira (adalimumab), and Remicade (infliximab). The fourth medication, Tysabri (natalizumab), is called an integrin receptor antagonist. It blocks certain types of white cells that are involved in inflammation. Because they suppress the immune system, all biologics an increased risk of infections, in rare cases can serious. Cimzia, Humira, and Remicade carry a boxed warning for increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization death. If someone taking a biologic develops serious infection, the drug should be discontinued. People with tuberculosis, heart failure, or multiple sclerosis should not take biologics because they can bring these conditions or make worse. In cases, some people taking TNF inhibitors have certain cancers such as lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects is part of body’s immune system. Tysabri increases the risk of a very rare but fatal brain infection progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). can cause allergic reactions and liver damage. Tysabri should not be used at the time that suppress the immune system or TNF inhibitors. However, most infections that occur with biologic use far less serious, says Richard Bloomfeld, MD, associate professor of medicine and director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, N.C. \"Infections such as colds, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary infections are common and don't necessarily alter our treatment of Crohn's.\" Other common effects from biologic use include flu-like symptoms, nausea, rash, injection site infusion reactions. So who should take a biologic for Crohn's? Many gastroenterologists reserve these drugs for people who have not responded to conventional medications that suppress the immune system. But some gastroenterologists may treat Crohn's more aggressively. \"If let inflammation go, inflammation leads to scarring and scarring to narrowing of intestines, which becomes a surgical problem,\" says Prabhakar Swaroop, MD, assistant professor and director of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas. \"You to treat person aggressively these problems.\" \"In addition to improving symptoms, the anti-TNF modifiers are associated with mucosal says Bloomfeld. \"We hope that in healing the mucosa we can stop the progression of the disease and prevent complications that result in hospitalization and surgery.\" While there are other treatments that suppress the immune system to treat Crohn's, they have side effects, says Bloomfeld. Like the biologics, that suppress the immune system increase the lymphomas and infections, which can be severe. Cortiosteroids like prednisone, for example, can cause a wide range of adverse effects including gain, mood swings, bone loss, skin bruising, high pressure, and high blood sugar. Those side are why corticosteroids may be used to a flare, aren't the to treat Crohn's over long period of time. \"The stop-gap method, which is steroids, is something we cannot use long term,\" says Swaroop. When prescribing any drug, doctors look at the potential risks against the benefits they hope or expect to achieve. Although doctors don't all the philosophy on to start biologics for Crohn's disease, they do agree that biologics should used when people severe disease that can lead to",

This second task, the that MST has accomplished best since its undertaking, is what causes us to think more directly of the educational dimension of the Movement. educational work of the MST three main dimensions: first, the recovery of the dignity of of families who once again have roots and purpose. The poor in everything have become citizens: people with people who study, produce, are a part their communities, and who, in their daily set a new of discussion for this country. The second dimension is the building of a collective identity, one which goes beyond each person, and settlement. The identity the Sem Terra [Landless], and the capital letters without like a proper name that identifies those who are no longer individuals who lack something have no land (land-less) but are individuals with a that of fighting for social justice and dignity for all. This places each member of Sem Terra, his/her participation in the in a movement that is related to the re-encounter of humanity with itself. third dimension is building the educational project different generations of the Sem Terra family, one that combines schooling with concerns of human development and the training of militants. Viewing the history of MST in perspective, some pedagogical lessons, or how the proponents of a social struggle and a collectivity in deal with, are concerned with, education. These lessons can help us reflect on each of our own educational practices, including that we undertake in the schools. Reflecting on these lessons, may to understand something even more profound: the MST has a that is, it has a praxis (combined theory and practice) of how people are educated, of how human beings develop. The of the Sem Terra Movement is the way through which the Movement has historically developed the social individual of the name Sem Terra, and daily educated the people are part of it. And the main educational principle this pedagogy is the movement itself, a movement that unites pedagogies, and a special way unites the of social struggle with the pedagogy of the land and the pedagogy of history, each one helping to make an imprint on our identity, mística, project. Sem Terra is the name of one who fights for the people have roots in the land the land that is tilled, cared for and in movement This is the main discussion we have today in the MST with our how to of the Pedagogy of the Movement a reference our practice and our thought.

It is a reference viewpoint aid in discerning the limits and challenges these practices. also educates our viewpoint to beyond the MST, beyond the Sem The Pedagogy of the Movement takes shape in a dialogue with educators, other students, and other pedagogical movements.

Developed country parties to the pledged greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets to be achieved by 2020. Most notably, country to the Accord also pledged mitigation actions. By January 31st deadline, pledges had been provided by countries representing approximately 80% of global GHG emissions. pledges made under Accord Adhering to legislation passed in its House of Representatives, the U.S. pledged a 17% reduction from levels.1 Canada also pledged a 17% from 2005 “to be aligned with the final economy-wide emissions target of the United States in enacted legislation.”2 Like many parties made contingent on action by others. The European Union, for example, pledged to reduce its emissions 20% 1990 levels, or by 30% other make comparable commitments. As example a mitigation action pledge of a developing country, China pledged to lower its intensity (per unit GDP) by 40-45% by 2020, increase to 15% the share of non-fossil fuels used in primary energy and to increase its forest and forest stock In comments following the announcement pledges, U.S. Special Envoy Climate Change, Todd Stern has it clear that the U.S. expects of developing countries, stronger mitigation actions than those contained in the Accord.4 the UN climate change conference The Accord was the outcome of the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (the “Conference”) to the Convention,5 attended yours truly. In an unprecedented display the prominence that climate change is gaining on the world stage, the Conference was attended by 115 heads of state over 40,000 delegates. The stage that was the Conference was not without its share of theatrics. When leaders arrived the days to that little progress had been made, the drama moved behind the scenes. In a telling moment, frustrated by negotiating only with Chinese Wen’s aides, U.S. President Obama walked in on private meeting between Wen the leaders of Brazil, India, and South Africa.6 It was these five major that would go on to produce Accord, which calls for any global temperature increase limited to two degrees Celsius.7 However the parties to the Convention’s Kyoto Protocol (the “Protocol”), the first period of which ends 2012, were unable to to its extension. The lack of consensus leaves in suspension the status of the Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism and the of the Certified Reductions (CERs) generated by thousands of projects thereunder. The International Emissions Trading (IETA), which a parallel conference, nevertheless remains optimistic: “an international injection of increased demand remains strong possibility over investment timescales but still has to be treated as an upside rather a given.”8 back on the home front As mentioned above, Canada’s climate change policy is explicitly tied to that of the United States. 2009 saw in the U.S. the passage in the House of Representatives of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (“Waxman-Markey”). calls for a 17% reduction of emissions below 2005 levels by 2020 and provides for the trading of allowances.9 Debate in the Senate of the Kerry-Boxer bill is nominally scheduled for debate this spring, though it may be 2011 before it comes to a floor vote. Tri-partisan senators John Kerry (D), Lindsey Graham (R) and Joe Lieberman (I) have taken it upon themselves to ensure passage of a climate (or “energy independence”) bill. For many U.S. senators, any climate legislation must be developing country emissions reductions and the international thereof. China and others are keen on international monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), Accord features compromise language. Countries communicate their actions “with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure sovereignty is respected.”10 any case, more than two thirds of Americans supporting the regulation of GHG emissions,11 the passage of legislation through Congress and, consequently, Canadian federal regulation, may be on the horizon. climate negotiations will occur in a number of fora this While sixteenth Conference of the Parties will occur in December in Cancun, one might now wonder how much can be expected of 192-party negotiations.

In much the same vein, Deep Ecology believes in the essential ecological equality of all species, man and mouse, elephant and earthworm.

For interconnection was the fundamental premise of relationship between traditional civilizations and nature.

Faster connections such as ISDN accordingly improved reception speed and sound quality.

The program began in 2007-2008 with two pilot schools, and eight schools during 2009-2010 school Teachers receive Master Naturalist certification and education credit after completing year-long program. learning expeditions The goal of the Learning Expeditions Schools program is to use environmental science as a theme to integrate learning about science, social studies, math, and language arts. program is a partnership between the LowCountry Institute, Clemson University's Youth Learning Institute, and Beaufort County Schools. The interdisciplinary lessons include trips, virtual field trips using video and PowerPoint programs, and hands-on activities in the classroom. These lessons use science standards to teach students how geography climate determine plant communities present turn, influence the economy and the history of the region. Math is integrated into through science and history-based word problems. Pilot for this program are Shell Point Elementary, Shanklin Elementary, Robert Middle School. During the 2012-2013 school year, the program will be made available to other district schools that wish to participate. - Grants: Several schools have been recipients of grants from LCI to outdoor classrooms and natural areas using plants teach students about pollination, plant lifecycles, and native habitats. - Hands-on programs: LCI staff and volunteers conduct programs schools to teach students about the plants and animals native to the Port Royal Sound System. - School field trips: LCI is able to invite a limited number of schools each year to participate in field trips on Spring Island where students learn about habitats and of the lowcountry. click image to see photos of our school programs",

Yesterday (October 11, 2012) the Maine Fuel Board voted allow Maine Energy Systems to engage in an “Emerging Technologies” project with them that might lead to elimination of one of those impediments for the pellet central heating industry State of Maine. Maine is unique in its licensure of technicians for “solid fuels.” In Maine a person installing must have fuel” authority on license to legally install a “solid fuel” boiler in someone else’s building. (It’s a bit more complicated than that, but let’s avoid the levels of license detail.) The need this apparently arose from potential hazards associated “solid fuel” the a thermal run-away a outage as combustion continues on a fuel while circulation fails to lack power, high chimney temperatures, and high boiler surface temperatures. As highly automatic pellet boilers made their way into the American market, were defined in Maine as “solid fuel” appliances because pellets are solid. that seems innocent and logical enough, the has one substantial flaw and it creates one impediment to product growth in the marketplace. State-of-the-art pellet boilers display none of the attributes that led to the perceived need “solid fuel” rules in Maine. The rules devised for cordwood and coal stoker that can hold a significant charge of fuel any given time. The combustion of that fuel is uncontrolled. Pellet boilers burn a very small quantity of fuel at any given time, the combustion of that fuel highly Combustion stops almost immediately if power goes out, hence, no excessive can be produced during a power outage. Cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers can produce very high stack temperatures. The exhaust gas from state-of-the-art pellet boilers are very much like those of modern oil boilers. In these boilers are so efficient, the stack gas temperature is often quite cool, 250F, or so, but it exceeds 400F. Therefore, chimney never Old cordwood and stoker boilers develop high temperatures making installed combustible surfaces important. The temperature these state-of-the-art pellet boilers is the same as the temperature of the room. The heat exchangers extremely well insulated to achieve the desired So, the worry about proximity of flammable materials due to high surface temperatures is not justified with these boilers. Because these highly sophisticated boilers are lumped in the same category as cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers, “solid fuel” license holders must install them in Maine. There fewer “solid fuel” license holders than ordinary oil license holders, so scheduling boiler installations in this rapidly growing segment is very challenging in the busy times of the year. Other busy technicians find it hard to justify studying for a test that focuses generally on boilers they’ll never see, so not to for the fuel” test to install pellet boilers as they’re just beginning to make mark the marketplace. The Emerging Technologies Project On October 11, 2012, the Maine Fuel Board approved a made by Maine Energy Systems for a year long project intended to confirm the company’s assertion that their boilers, and those similar to them, can installed oil boiler license holders who have been trained in the pellet boilers and oil boilers. This is great news for the pellet industry in Maine the State’s boiler inspect some, or all, these installations and, thereby, become much more familiar with these sorts of systems. If the project leads to the anticipated conclusion, request re-categorize the boilers for licensure requirement purposes should received. We have little doubt that the Project will reach conclusion as these very boilers are installed throughout the Northeast by the same technicians install boilers and have been trained at Maine Energy Systems in fuel handling and burner In the meantime, Maine Energy Systems will be training oil technicians in the installation of their equipment to ensure that who to install the MESys AutoPellet boiler can do it this heating on a schedule works for them.

Although they know what they say and have intact muscle strength, they have difficulty programming the movements for speech. They are able to hear their speech errors, the program focuses on identifying these errors and correcting them. For most people, focusing on these mistakes results in little improvement in their speech. In to conventional treatment approaches, Dr. Jacks and his colleagues (Katarina Haley, DAHS, DSHS; Heidi Roth, Department of Neurology) are studying the effects of preventing the person with apraxia of speech from hearing the errors their speech, by playing loud through earphones. This approach on the premise that people this speech disorder are to speech which prevents them from speaking fluently. The same phenomenon has been known for decades help people who stutter to speak as demonstrated in the popular film The King's Speech. In the proposed research, Jacks and his colleagues seek to identify stroke survivors who respond positively to listening to noise rate and decreasing the occurrence of speech disfluencies (pauses, filler words, repetitions). Since not all people are expected to show change in speech while listening to noise, the will study individual characteristics to determine what differentiates those who improve those who do not. In particular, behavioral profiles (type of speech language and location and size of brain lesion will be compared between positive responders and non-responders to determine whether a positive response can be from routine clinical data. In preliminary work, over half of participants tested spoke more quickly and with fewer disfluencies while listening to noise. Although this is a temporary effect and does not persist after the noise turned off, the moments of speech fluency experienced may cause the person's brain to activate in a different way than it when he or is speaking disfluently. If the preliminary results are borne out in the completed study, Dr. Jacks and his team believe that the may be further developed into a useful therapeutic technique that can result in lasting speech changes.",

For six weeks it rampaged through the forest killing every kiwi it encountered. the time the dog was found, as many as 500 of the kiwi living there had been slaughtered. This carnage at Waitangi illustrates just how vulnerable the kiwi is to and the speed at which seemingly populations can fail. Other predators introduced to Zealand by may cause similar havoc. The main threat to the is posed by: Possums, stoats, ferrets, and feral (wild) cats who steal eggs and kill young. Larger predators pigs and dogs. Young kiwi leave the nest just three weeks of age, weighing 200g. Small and slow, they are easy prey. few survive this precarious journey from birth to 12 when they reach the critical size that enables them up to predators. Humans, primarily through destroying introducing predators the place, pose the single threat to the kiwi. Ironically, we are also their greatest hope. kiwi is a one-off evolutionary design, holding all sorts of biological records. New Zealand's ancient isolation and lack of mammals allowed it to occupy a habitat lifestyle that else in world would be by a Whereas birds traditionally depend on sight, the is one of the few birds with a highly sense of smell. You can sometimes hear them sniffing around in the dark. Alarm them during the day and they will run off. Then, at a distance, just like a wolf or other mammal, they'll stick their bill (nose) in the air, sniffing to see if they are safe from pursuit. Other reasons the kiwi could pass for a mammal is its loose, hair-like feathers, its whiskers, the fact it can't fly and that it burrows in the ground. Other kiwi curiosities include: Being the known bird to have external nostrils at the of its bill. sniffs out its food a bill-length below huge eggs. The kiwi has one of the largest weight of any bird. The mature egg averages 20% of the body weight. Compare that to 2% for an ostrich! Being smallest member of the ratite family includes ostriches and emus). live in pairs — for most, if not all of their lives. Sex role reversal: The female is bigger dominates the male. In some varieties, the male most of the incubating of the eggs. The eggs take an exceedingly long time to hatch — up to 80 days. Kiwi tend to live in pairs, forming monogamous couples. These bonds generally till death and known to last over 30 years. About every third day, the pair will shelter in the same burrow together. The relationship tends be quite volatile and physical, female generally calling the over her smaller partner. During the night, as they are out foraging for or patrolling they will perform duets, calling to each other. The female has a lower hoarser call than the male. From the outside, it doesn't that kiwi domestic life is bliss. But the bond long-lasting. There are few surprises in the kiwi diet. It's mostly earthworms, spiders, fallen fruits seeds, larvae of beetles and cicada and a mixture of forest invertebrates. But they will also take large food items like freshwater crays and even frogs. In captivity, kiwi fished eels out of a pond, subdued them with a thuds and eaten them. Kiwi are extremely territorial birds, They protect their patch — which can be as much 40 hectares — by calling or, if that fails, by chasing the intruder kiwi and giving it a good booting over. Very occasionally, kiwi kill each other fighting territory. Acutely aware of neighbours, they will engage in calling duels. If a is intruding into another's space, will rush back at full speed into its own space before returning a neighbour's call. A gathering of kiwi is a rarity. However, on Island, they do live in small, mixed family groupings. Kiwi Nests, er, Burrows! Kiwi are burrowers. They may quickly clear a burrow at the end of a night's work, crash there during the day and then move on to a new burrow the next day. Spotted Kiwi prefer dens.

The report also discusses how decisive policies can roll back the impending doom. (Read the at globalchange.gov.) Here are two of key findings: • Climate changes are under way in the United States and are projected to grow. These include increases in heavy downpours, rising and level, rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing permafrost, lengthening growing seasons, ice-free seasons in the ocean and on lakes rivers, earlier snowmelt and alterations in flows. • is considered one of the sectors most adaptable to changes in climate, but increased heat, pests, water stress, diseases and will pose adaptation challenges for crop and livestock production.

A global recession is real and painful, but compared to the apocalyptic effects of unchecked global warming, but a pinprick. What does this have to do with food? while the U.S. government appears to be finally getting serious about acting against global warming, we the people need to do as much as can. Food strikes me as particularly target-rich as seek to reduce global I see reducing our consumption of meat as the single most action we can take as individuals.

I'm a believer in spending more for quality, food included. But eating well shouldn't be prohibitively expensive. I guess it's all in how one defines \"eating well.\" For me, that means little or no processed food and plenty of fresh produce in season. Food is course a necessary expense, but there's a lot of discretion how to spend your food But the ironic thing about food you fresh, unprocessed ingredients cook for yourself rather than opening a can or box, eating well generally costs less. At least that's my belief. According the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), livestock production nearly a fifth of the world's greenhouse gases, more than transportation. Animal agriculture is the leading of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which--combined with carbon dioxide--are the primary causes of global Livestock production accounts for than percent global human water use, the FAO says. Evidence suggests that is also the largest source of water pollution thanks to animal wastes, antibiotics, hormones, fertilizers pesticides used for feed crops, from eroded pastures. estimated 30 percent of the ice-free land is involved in livestock production.

The method applies a median filter remove fine detail, this from the original to isolate the detail, and adds the original image back to enhance the as shown in the Rank Masking This method is called a rank mask, but is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to a top hat filter (the real top is shown below).

To this essay easier to read, I say or multilingual\" time the \"bilingual\" comes up but in most places, applies to bilinguals also applies to multilingual speakers - as far as we know - so far. Mystery 1: How many bilingual people are there? It is sometimes confusing to even try to discuss bilingualism because the word bilingual means different things to different For people, bilinguals are people who speak two (or more - for multilinguals) languages equally and perfectly. People who speak two languages lives, and can do things such as talking to people at work, reading the newspaper, understanding conversations with friends sometimes say \"Oh yes, I do all that. But I am not bilingual\". Other people describe as bilingual if they communicate ideas, even if they make many errors in grammar and pronunciation and have a very small vocabulary in language. In research, both kinds of are as having different levels of Ratings 1 7 or 1 to 9 are often where person along the continuous line that goes from \"I ONLY know one language\" to \"I am one rare people who feels equally at home in two languages, no what the task topic\". For speaking, hearing, and writing, most of us are at slightly levels of ability, in each of the languages we know. For this essay - and the discussions I hope it will spark - let's of bilingualism being a continuum. We don't divide the world into tall and short people. There is no cut-off to separate \"tall\" from \"short\". Same thing for is at some point along the line that goes from strongly unilingual to very, very bilingual. With a definition of bilingualism, some authors estimate that there are at least as many people the world who need to use or more languages in their as there are people who can only in one language for example, Bhatia & Ritchie, 2006). We cannot precise estimates unless we first define what levels of bilingualism are included or excluded from the count (and where to divide from languages). Mystery 2: Is the incidence of stuttering the in different languages? There are studies of the of stuttering in different countries. Some authors use these studies to say things like \"the incidence of stuttering is in X than in Country Y\". But, if each study used ways sampling and different ways of determining who stutters, it is not valid to compare across studies. For example, from one study to the next, different methods were used in deciding who is stuttering: parent reports? Teachers in or centres? Parents remembering what the child was 5 or 10 years ago? There are also differences in counts as stuttering: only for a few months at age 3? Only people who stuttered for more a year? Only those who reach a given level of severity? When people see these reports, about why the incidence figures SEEM to be different (ignoring the differences in how the estimates were reached), using their favourite aspect of stuttering as the explanation. Thus, we see like: 1) is stuttering in Country X than in Country Y because the grammar language spoken in Country X makes greater demands on The complexity of a language might be relevant, some subtle including the location of moments of stuttering within a sentence. Concluding that the language itself influences the number of who a huge, dangerous leap of logic. are other possible explanations that have be ruled out before we can select one of them and reject the others. 2) \"There is more in ___ because that culture views speaking well as very pressure to well makes people stutter\".

Under this approach, specially trained student mediators work with their peers resolve Mediation programs reduce the use of traditional disciplinary actions such as suspension, detention, and expulsion; encourage effective problem solving; decrease the need for teacher involvement student conflicts; and improve climate. An example of a Peer Mediation program is We Can Work It Out, developed by the National Institute for Citizenship Education in the the Crime Prevention Council. The promotes mediation, negotiation, or other non-litigating methods as strategies to unresolved confrontations and fighting.

Subject matter included traditional, State-required subjects, but also anthropology, technology, social sciences, drawing, singing, and handwork--all generally neglected in State- and schools. Most radical were the in art physical education (stressing free inquiry, observation, and spontaneous criticism in the former, and development of whole the latter) and the institution of field trips, hiking, and nature observation. The use of textbooks was discouraged as much as possible, and examinations were regarded as producing mostly negative results. Emphasis placed instead upon the creation of student notebooks that reflected the pupil's and synthesis materials. Don Francisco borrowed much from the French and English forms of education, and was by Rousseau, Froebel, Pestalozzi, Krause, and Sanz Del Rio, the last provided ideal of all human facilities to produce an artistic taste, technical preparedness, spiritual elevation an austere, of life.

(MB) It has been said of Spanish \"What Spanish philosophy?\" The same reproach might be directed at the non-existence of Spanish education. \"There ain't no such animal,\" some might claim, forgetting for the moment the intellectual freedom and depth of thirteenth-century Toledo under the reign of Alfonso X, the Wise (El Sabio), and the splendor revival of learning in the Universities of Salamanca, Alcala and other institutions. What is mostly however, is the disheartening decline Spanish education, ushered in by the fears and intolerance of the Catholic of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain. But this view of education in Spain, of necessity simplified, would be complete without of the establishment and significance of Instititucion Libre de Ensenanza, in English, the Free Institution/Institute of Education. In order to understand clearly the Institute's impact on Spanish society, I will review very quickly some the historical background to its founding in 1876. A broad overview of nineteenth-century Spain reveals to us that the \"lack of civility\" Spaniards, which reached such extreme proportions during the 1936-30 Civil War, had its in the century. Civil war, frequent military uprisings in the form of \"pronunciamientos,\" dissension everywhere created an ambience of and fragmentation within Historians talk of \"Las dos Espanas,\" the \"two that is, the liberal, progressive side opposed to the traditional, reactionary side of the country. is probably more accurate, however, to talk of the many Spains. disagree was the Spaniard's right -- no, his duty to himself, his own proud sense of individuality dignity. A solution imposed from above, from the State, seemed, in many cases, the only solution there were problems, there were many -- economic, political, religious. The problem of Spanish education was only of several, and too came to be subsumed into the more general and overriding conflict of State versus of Authority vs. Freedom. Reconciling such absolutes frequently failed; worse still, the distinction between philosophy and ideology, that is, between the search for truth and the molding, distorting of existential reality to one's conception of it, this would too often become blurred in disputes and violence nineteenth-century Spain. Tempers rose, were unleashed, ideologies reigned supreme, and somewhere in the shuffle, of vision and truth were lost. This split in Spanish society in part gave birth to the Free Institute Specifically, we must look to years 1868 and 1874 to explain how the came being. The date 1868 conjures up one outstanding event in modern Spanish history: the overthrow of the reigning Bourbon monarch, Isabel II, an action termed the Glorious of 1868. It w",

News reports describe such hazards as pollutants in the air in drinking water, pes- ticide residues in food, threats from radiation and toxic chemicals, and ATDS. Government and also out about hazards their risks, to the populace but more often through intermediaries, such as print and broadcast media.

This statement places an risk (radon exposure in in juxtaposition a more familiar risk (death in an accident), may help people understand the magnitude of unfamiliar risk. this simple comparison may be misleading because it does not specify the respective levels of exposure, leaves out potentially nonlethal and (picocuries liter) unfamiliar people. This report addresses these and other problems confronting risk communication. OCR for page 2 2 IMPROVING messages be controversial for reasons. The haz- ards they describe are often centers of controversy. Fre- quently, there is enough uncertainty in the underlying knowledge to allow different experts to draw Experts are frequently accused of their subjective preferences behind technical jargon and so-called objective analyses. Often a message that is precise and accurate must be so complex that only an expert can understand it. Messages that nonexperts can under- necessarily present selected information and are thus challenge as being inaccurate, incomplete, or manipulative. In the past the term risk communication has commonly been thought of as consisting only of one-way messages from experts to nonexperts. In this report the Committee on Risk Perception and Communication takes perspective. Because of the controversy seems to center on the content of specific messages, it was tempting to proceed along the lines of many previous discussions about risk communication and on message design. We found a focus on one-way too limiting, however. Instead, we make crucial distinction between risk messages and the risk communication process. We see risk communication as an interactive process of exchange of information and opinion among groups, and institutions. When risk communication is in significant, though perhaps less obvious, underlying problems can be better discerned and treated. We view in risk communication in a way Some take the that risk communication is successful when recipients accept the views or arguments of the communicator. We construe risk communication to be successful to the extent it raises the level of of relevant issues or actions those involved and satisfies them that they are informed within limits of available knowledge. Finally, it should be noted that one of the most difficult issues we faced concerned the extent to which public in a demo- cratic society should attempt to influence is, to go beyond merely informing them concerning risks risk- reducing actions as smoking. Government officials be accountable for their decisions and will likely find their efforts to influence contested if they stray accepted scientific views or if they challenge popular consensus.

Although caution that no single weather event can be attributed directly to climate change, major as Katrina and this summer’s drought fire up a debate that has become more incendiary in recent years as more Republican lawmakers doubt climate science. The question of whether the GOP climate science didn’t come up in 2008, when Hurricane Gustav slammed the Gulf Coast during the party’s Minnesota convention. That’s because the nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, believed in climate change and professed a desire to solve it. then, the mainstream GOP is to deny the scientific findings that link man-made pollution climate change, and Mitt Romney has publicly walked back his onetime position humans contribute to warming. Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also questioned the science. stronger hurricanes are the most serious consequences of climate change induced burning of fuels (the Romney campaign favors such burning), and the Gulf Coast is likely to experience the worst effects, according to a 2012 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a 2009 report authored by 13 federal agencies. Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has authored one of many reports on the increasing of high-intensity hurricanes, said that the data warming air and water surfaces to stronger, devastating “As temperature of the tropical ocean increases, you see greater intensity the frequency of intense storms goes up,” said. Michael a professor of geosciences at Princeton and a member of the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the science shows clearly that reducing oil, coal, and gas pollution could help prevent damage related climate change. “There’s a risk, scientists have identified, that it’s likely we’ll have more strong hurricanes, and one of the things we can do to prepare is reduce fossil-fuel emissions,” said. “It’s just like building levees.” Environmentalists are targeting Republicans for their views. Around Tampa, the Florida Wildlife Federation posted billboards of prominent Republicans, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who have acknowledged climate as a problem and called for solutions. “We think this is one of the most important policy issues that there is,” said Federation Fuller. “It’s as a partisan issue, and it should not The billboards remind Republicans of what well-known Republicans have said about this.” Last week, the League of Voters launched a $1.5 campaign defeat five House Republicans who deny science of climate change. “Flat Earth Five” campaign is the first time the League has targeted a group of lawmakers explicitly because of their positions on climate.

How you have a tracheostomy depends on the condition that required you to get it and your overall health. To understand how tracheostomy works, it helps to understand how your airways work.

The air travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits two bronchi that your lungs. (For information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.) A tracheostomy provides another way for oxygen-rich air to reach your lungs, besides going through your nose mouth. A breathing tube, also called a trach (trake) tube, is put through the tracheostomy and directly into the windpipe to help you breathe. Doctors use tracheostomies for many reasons. One common is to help people who need to be on ventilators (VEN-til-a-tors) for more than a couple of weeks. Ventilators are machines support breathing. If you have a tracheostomy, the trach tube connects to the ventilator. People who have conditions that interfere with coughing or block the upper airways also may need tracheostomies. Coughing is a natural reflex that protects the lungs. It helps clear (a slimy substance) and bacteria from the airways. A trach tube can be used to help remove, or suction, mucus from the airways. might recommend tracheostomies for people have problems due strokes or other conditions.

Meanwhile the BBC says that diesel fumes are “definitely a cause of cancer”. This widely reported news is based on a decision by the WHO to classify diesel exhausts as a cause of cancer. The decision was by the WHO’s International Agency for Research Cancer (IARC), a panel of experts that co-ordinates conducts research into the causes of cancer, and develops cancer control strategies. Under its classification scheme, diesel exhaust was previously categorised as “probably carcinogenic”. The says there is now sufficient evidence that exposure diesel fumes causes lung cancer. It is calling for exposure to diesel fumes to be reduced worldwide. While diesel fumes now officially carcinogenic, the alarmist tone of the Daily Mail’s headline should be viewed with caution the ‘deadly category’ of substances the Mail describes also includes sunlight and wood dust. What is diesel and is used much in the UK? oil is a complex mixture of chemicals, mainly distilled from crude oil, although vegetable oil and similar sources can be used make ‘biodiesel’. It is used as fuel for internal combustion engines, which use compressed hot air to ignite fuel (petrol engines have spark to ignite the fuel). Worldwide, diesel oil is widely used as fuel in diesel-powered cars, lorries, trains, aircraft, ships industry. is regarded as efficient than petroleum, resulting in lower fuel consumption. WHO many people are exposed to diesel exhaust in everyday life, both through their occupations in the ambient air. of just 50% of all new car sales in the UK were diesel, according to the Society of Manufacturers Traders. 2004, approximately litres (150 gallons) of diesel every second in UK, according to a report by the Health Protection Agency The amount of pollutants from diesel fumes, in particular its sulphur content, have been reduced over the last few years, engines on newer cars are designed to burn fuel efficiently, emissions. However, the IARC says is not yet clear how these improvements translate into any changes in the impact of diesel fumes on human fuels and older unmodified take years to replace, particularly in less developed countries where regulations are less stringent, IARC says. What is the WHO’s classification scheme? The WHO classifies the cancer-causing potential of various substances into four groups, depending on the evidence available in both humans and other animals: - Group is used when a substance causes cancer in humans - Group 2A is used when a substance ‘probably’ causes cancer in humans - Group 2B used when a substance ‘possibly’ causes cancer in humans - Group 3 is used when a substance is classifiable in terms of its cancer-causing properties in humans because the evidence is inadequate - 4 is used when a substance is ‘probably not’ a cause of cancer in humans What is the WHO now about diesel fumes and cancer? Since 1988, oil fumes have been classified by the IARC as ‘probably carcinogenic humans’. This category is used when there is some, limited evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans, but sufficient evidence it causes cancer in experimental animals. However, the IARC has now reclassified engine exhaust as ‘carcinogenic’ (group 1 on the list above). This category used when there is sufficient evidence that a substance causes cancer in humans. The IARC says there is sufficient evidence diesel is a cause of lung cancer. It is also associated with an increased risk of cancer, although the evidence for the latter is more limited. Why has changed? The WHO says there has been mounting concern in recent the cancer-causing potential of diesel engine exhaust, based on from epidemiological studies of workers exposed diesel fumes. In particular, it cites a large cohort study, published in March this year, of occupational exposure to in US miners. The study run by the US National Cancer Institute and the Institute Occupational Safety Health. It found that to diesel exhaust increased the of dying from lung cancer (1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.44). further case-control study, in this group (comparing 198 miners who had died from lung cancer with 562 miners who were alive at the time the ‘case’ died), found that the risk of lung these workers with the length of time they were exposed to fumes.

The ultimate objective was to understand if the US History classes are serving the perceived of Latino students. Latinos are 40% of nation’s minorities, are the youngest population and are the fastest growing. The studies is the curriculum area for challenging the dominant worldview and teaching about the diversity present in the classroom, the nation, and the world; therefore, learning more about socio-culturally inclusive social studies curriculum and pedagogy is an important consideration. This project is significant because it intersects with topics to the future of our nation: schools, the studies curriculum, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students, students’ perspectives. Furthermore, the focus this research overlaps with the reality of today’s educational system: state content standards and high stakes testing. All of these aspects will be addressed. This was influenced by Latino Critical Theory. LatCrit an outgrowth of Critical Race (hereafter known CRT).

A major of this study was the US History is or is not meeting participants’ needs in different based upon pertinent characteristics of the Latino students’ responses were informed by the following critical factors: English speaking ability, recency of arrival in the United States, and level of integration into the power structures of the state where the research was The level of integration was further influenced by documentation status (their legal status in the US), parents’ English speaking ability, and the English speaking ability of members in a student’s and immediate neighborhood. Students’ responses fell into three groups based upon these characteristics. The students in Group One stressed the basic need to learn English. Maslow described motivation with Maslow’s Hierarchy of Perhaps what students in Group One were me—their most basic needs had to be met before they would be ready to “grow” in American schools. Group Two student-participants wanted their culture to be present that other students—particularly White students—would learn about them. Group Three students conformed to studies with White students—they wanted to learn in more interactive working with groups, and being stimulated with flashy videos. Students at Crawford did not have an adequate framework around which to make sense of race, racism, and tensions. The presence of how race was talked about, the absence of how race was not talked about, led to negative against Latinos based upon ethnicity, immigration status, and native language. one teacher demonstrated a closed paradigm of ethnicity and skin color that silenced one of students. The student-participants in all wanted to talk about race. They to talk about their “positive invisibility” at Crawford—that is, the of affirmative constructions around their ethnicity, country of origin, and language. The findings suggest that there is need for more studies with Latino students that focus the aspects of Latino Critical Theory. This dissertation is to the students, my and my friends world.

That includes 9x, ME, NT, and 2000. In this article I'm going to go the process of installing PHP on Windows and explain what you should look out for. On Windows, as on Unix, you have two options for installing PHP: as CGI or as an ISAPI module. The obvious benefit of the latter is The downside is that this is still somewhat new may be as stable. before you do anything, you have to do some prep work, which pretty simple. Once you've downloaded and Windows binary of PHP, you copy php4isapi.dll from the sapi/ to WINNT/system or WINDOWS/system directories. You'll also probably want to move php.ini-dist from your installation directory to the WINDOWS/ directory and it to php.ini, you plan on changing any of defaults. Now you're ready go, regardless of whether you use as a CGI or ISAPI module. For NT/2000, need to tell IIS how to recognize PHP. Thanks to the of GUI, can easily be accomplished with a few First, fire up the Microsoft Console or Internet Service Manager, depending on whether you're using NT or 2000. Click on the button of the web node you'll be working with. In this example we'll Default Web Server. Click the ISAPI Filters tab and then click Add. Use php as the name and in the path put the location of php4isapi.dll, which should be in this example. Configuring IIS to recognize PHP. Under the Directory tab, click the Configuration button, then click Add for Application Use the same location as did with ISAP Filters and as the extension. comes the caveat!! As a test, tried using as the temporary location which was in the install on my desktop. Windows 2000 popped up a wonderfully annoying little box telling me I'm stupid and should go dunk my head sand. OK, so it wasn't quite that wordy, but how I took it. Windows 2000 and IIS require App Mappings to be under the WINDOWS dir at least. So keep that in mind if you don't sand up your nose. Now, click OK on the Properties dialog. The next thing to do start and stop IIS. This isn't same as pushing the stop and start buttons on the Management Console. You should go to a command (or cmd, as it were) window and type net stop issadmin. Wait for to tell you what it's doing, as you were nosy enough to care, and then type net start w3svc. Why they make it net start iisadmin is beyond me. But I'm a Unix guy, and logic seems to be my downfall here. But I digress... So now you have PHP installed as an ISAPI module on Windows! Aren't you happy? Probably because you probably don't believe me. Well, if you need proof just go to C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ and put a file called test.php in there. Inside that file put the following code: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Then pull up test.php in your browser. you see the PHP page, worked! Now this probably goes without saying, so I'll say it. You to pull up test.php a web page in browser using http://. If you give the path for the file using file://, then you'll get a raw output of the code, which is no fun. The PHP Info page indicates success. Windows 9x/ME, you're restricted to PWS (Personal Web Server). Of course there are alternatives such as OmniHTTPd, but we don't have all day here! Anyway, this far simpler. It's mainly just a matter of a registry entry. After moved php4ts.dll to the directories, you should open up your favorite registry At this point I note the obligatory warnings about fooling around with the registry, blah, blah, blah... In HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\w3svc\\parameters\\Script Map, you'll to add an entry with the name .php and a value of Next, go start the PWS Manager. For each of the directories that you want to make aware, you have right-click on that directory check the executable box. Now you're ready.

I’ve watched the preemies the nursery get stuck tubes in every orifice while incubators try to mimic the womb and ventilators push air into their undeveloped lungs. I’ve seen children, years later, get wheeled into my room after enduring countless surgeries to deal with the disabilities prematurity cause. And I’ve attended the we imprison in the hospital weeks on end we try this pregnancy complication. We don’t know what causes preterm labor. If we did, might be able to prevent it. It’s still one of the great mysteries of obstetrics. advances like gene therapy and transplant surgery revolutionize health care, we still understand the most basic things about how pregnancy works. In fact, at University Chicago, there’s an empty plaque, awaiting the name of the person who discovers what causes labor, so we can learn to preterm birth. So we’re still clueless. But we’ve made progress in the past decade. When a New England Journal of Medicine article that the hormone 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-P) would reduce the risk of preterm birth, listened. However, this drug, which used to be used to treat birth, had of favor, and no manufacturers made it anymore. So got and started getting 17-P from compounding pharmacies, where it could be manufactured from scratch for about per dose. Because the quality of pharmacies vary, and because what drug a gets during pregnancy matters, docs were happy when the FDA approved new drug Makena which would standardize 17-P and make it readily available at hospitals and pharmacies. The FDA reviewed data of a study that showed that, among women with a prior preterm birth, women given Makena in a subsequent pregnancy had a preterm birth rate of 37%, compared to in the control Good news, eh? You’d think. So KV Pharmaceutical, who won seven years of exclusive rights on this drug that been around since the 1950s, then started firing off letters to compounding pharmacies, announcing that they could no longer make 17-P available to the public without facing possible legal action. Which means that women at high risk must now buy Makena, instead of relying upon their friendly neighborhood pharmacist to make it up. So how much does the new (old) drug cost? $1500 per dose. Yes, you heard me right. This $20 drug now costs per dose. That’s about $30,000 per at-risk pregnancy. And insurances get to decide individually whether or not they will cover it -- but even if they that’ll mean co-pays and deductibles. just say it like it is? BULLSHIT. you, Big Pharma. Are you telling me that women who at risk of preterm (lower socio-economic women are at the highest risk) will have to up 30 grand if they want to prevent a pregnancy or raising a disabled child because insurance won’t cover it? Are you telling me our health care industry is so broken that, instead of this ancient drug at price and preventing preterm births, they’d prefer to pay millions to care for that preemie in the NICU or treat that disabled child? Why? Why? Why? Why this According to the Washington Post, “FDA officials that they had no idea how much the planned to charge the drug and were by the cost but that the agency has no power over pricing.” How did our health care industry become so broken that kind of thing can happen? Where is the heart in medicine these days? When did patient care start taking a backseat to the bottom line? No wonder patients health care alike feel so frustrated, demoralized, and disempowered. Something’s gotta change. According to the same FDA official, “If requested, the agency could approve a lower-priced generic version of the drug for another use that doctors prescribe 'off label.'” The also said that the agency would not compounding pharmacies from continuing to provide 17-P unless patient safety is to be “We have our hands full pursuing our enforcement priorities,” the said to the Post. “And it’s not for a physician to write prescription for a compounded drug or for a patient to take a compounded drug. We certainly are concerned about access of patients to medication.” So if you or anyone know had a previous preterm baby, tell them to ask their doctor about prescribing 17-P. If the doctor thinks they are a good for suggest getting it from a compounding pharmacy, rather than supporting a Big Pharm",

A modern desktop computer today may include jacks to accommodate ethernet, USB 2.0, FireWire or 800 (IEEE 1394a or 1394b) DVI DisplayPort or both, - on some -eSATA.

That would enable a camcorder forgo video compression hardware patent licensing fees for MPEG-4. The user could either stream video from a simple camcorder (with no video processing required) or store it on internal drive for later rapid transfer; neither of methods is feasible today without heavy compression. Citing 3.0's versatility, some analysts see the standard as a possible complement - or even alternative - to the consumer HDMI connection found today's Blu-ray players. The new USB could also turn computers into real charging stations. Whereas USB 2.0 can produce 100 milliamperes (mA) of trickle charge for each port, USB 3.0 ups quantity to 150mA per device. 2.0 tops out at 500mA for a the maximum for USB 3.0 is 900mA. With mobile phones moving to support USB as the standard for charging and syncing, the increased amperage of USB 3.0 might let you do away with warts (AC adapters) of all kinds. In light of the increased importance and use of USB in its 3.0 version, future desktop computers may very well have two internal hubs, with several ports easily accessible in the to act as a charging station.

The Slides for the Perl 6 is just a SMOP are available, it introduces a bit the reasoning behind SMOP. A newer version of the talk presented at YAPC::EU 2008 is available SMOP is an alternative implementation of a C to run Perl 6. It is focused in the most pragmatic approach possible, but still focusing in being able to support all Perl 6 features. Its core resembles Perl 5 in some ways, and it differs from Parrot in many ways, including the fact that SMOP is a Virtual Machine. SMOP is simply a runtime engine that happens to have a interpreter run The main difference SMOP and Parrot (besides the not-being-a-vm thing), is that SMOP is from bottom-up an implementation of the Perl 6 OO features, in a way SMOP be able to do a full bootstrap of the 6 type system. Parrot on the other hand have a much more static implementation (the PMC) The same way PGE is a project on of Parrot, SMOP will a grammar engine for itself. SMOP is the implementation that is stressing the meta protocol more than any other implementation, and so far that has a very fruitful exercise, with Larry making many clarifications on the object system thanks to SMOP. Important topics on - SMOP doesn't recurse the C stack, and it doesn't actually define a mandatory paradigm (stack-based or register-based). SMOP has a Polymorphic Eval, that allows you to switch from interpreter to another using Passing Style. See SMOP Stackless. - SMOP doesn't define a object system in its own. The only thing it defines is the concept of Responder which then encapsulates whatever object system. This feature is fundamental to implement the SMOP Native Types. - is intended to bootstrap from the low-level to the high-level. This is achieved by the fact that in SMOP is an Object. This way, even the low-level objects can be exposed to level runtime. See SMOP OO Bootstrap. - SMOP implement a in its own, it will use STD or whatever parser gets ported to its runtime - In order to enable the bootstrap, the runtime have a set of Constant Identifiers that are available the sub-language compilers use. - There are some special SMOP Values Not Subject to Collection. - A interpreter implementation SMOP Mold replaced SLIME - The \"official\" smop Perl 6 compiler mildew - it lives in v6/mildew - Currently there exists an Elf backend which - it lives in misc/elfish/elfX SMOP GSoC See the Old SMOP Changelog",

Because it is relatively inexpensive and be orally, clomiphene is generally one of the first medications prescribed for patients who not ovulate regularly. In women who do ovulate regularly, clomiphene may be used for \"superovulation,\" where or 3 eggs are increases the number of \"targets\" for the sperm, thereby increasing the chance pregnancy. Clomiphene is normally administered for five during the follicular part of the cycle (the portion of the cycle following menstrual bleeding). Clomiphene is similar to estrogen and acts on the estrogen receptor. First approved by the FDA in 1967, it has recently as a selective-estrogen-receptor-modulator (SERM). How does clomiphene work? The hormonal signals that cause ovarian follicles to grow are released from the pituitary gland. These hormones are named Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Leutinizing Hormone (LH) for their actions in the ovary. The receives its signals from hypothalamus in the Clomiphene the estrogen receptor and \"tricks\" the brain into thinking there are low levels of estrogen. The pituitary responds by releasing FSH and LH, thus stimulating follicular growth in the ovaries. Whereas clomiphene \"tricks\" the pituitary producing more FSH and LH, gonadotropin injections of FSH and LH increase the amount of signals directly. Treatment with these injections requires more intensive monitoring does therapy with clomiphene. In general, treatment with fertility medications is initiated to help women overcome dysfunction, or produce multiple so there is a higher chance of achieving pregnancy. In the \"Clomiphene citrate challenge test\" (CCCT), clomiphene is and FSH levels are before and after treatment. theory, clomiphene blocks the negative feedback of estrogen, only inhibin (a substance that inhibits FSH) to suppress FSH. In some women, inhibin alone is able to block the high levels of FSH without the help of estrogen. The CCCT will therefore be abnormal and show high FSH levels after clomiphene in women with diminished ovarian reserve. While the CCCT help to identify some patients with diminished ovarian there is no single test that can predict which patients can or cannot become pregnant.",

University of Missouri-Columbia Professor Ray Semlitsch is trying to change that view and explain the importance of smaller wetlands before managed out of existence. \"Large wetlands are beautiful and need to be protected, but some animal species such as frogs, toads and salamanders, it is small wetlands that support greater species diversity,\" said Semlitsch, who along his research assistant, Russ Bodie, recently published their research in Conservation Biology. \"These smaller, temporary wetlands--because they dry times during the year--are much to appreciate than vast marsh areas. But without these smaller wetlands, it is very possible that much the animal and plant life that make wetlands rich, productive habitats would not survive. We need worry about the conservation of smaller wetlands as as the larger Small wetlands currently are defined as being less than 4 hectares, or about 8 9 acres. The of the nation's are much smaller than might be imagined, closer to 1 2 acres and sometimes as small as square yards. small wetlands may comprise the majority of wetlands in the United States and help support a vast of species. However, unlike the wetlands, these smaller areas are protected to the same extent. Recently, the Army of Engineers, which manages wetlands of all throughout the United States, drafted regulations that will the way wetlands managed in the future. They have put off any change in management until April, but the researchers argue that in the regulations could manage these smaller wetlands out of existence. \"Right now we can't detect losses of small wetlands by satellite imagery, a technique used to assess environmental change,\" said. \"We lose thousands of acres each in and these smaller ones are not even taken into account. Yet, they play a vital role in the ecosystem and support a great variety of organisms.\" Research by Semlitsch and Bodie has indicated that when some individuals of a species move between wetlands, this increases their chances of survival. By populating many different wetlands, various species thrive, even during years when some wetlands are dry. When smaller wetlands are destroyed, the chances of survival for many species' may decrease dramatically because between individual wetlands longer, making movement between wetlands more difficult. These small breeding sites for amphibians especially critical in light of purported world-wide declines, Semlitsch said. Wetlands in general also have direct benefits to humans as they filter out chemicals and silt, buffer from flooding, are favorite of hunters and fishers. They also are very costly and difficult to develop for construction or other purposes.

Alongside researchers from the University of Rochester, Harvard University, and the National Synthesis Center, Mahler wanted to understand how and when this range of shapes and sizes came to be.

In addition measuring the head, limbs, tail of over a thousand museum representing nearly Anolis species in the Greater Antilles -- including several Cuban species were previously inaccessible to North American scientists -- they used the Anolis family tree to what species lived which islands, and when. By doing so, they discovered that widest variety of anole shapes and arose among the evolutionary early-birds. Then as the number of anole species on each island increased, the range of new body types to fizzle. Late-comers in lizard evolution underwent finer and finer tinkering as time went on. species proliferated on each island, their descendants were forced partition the remaining real estate in increasingly subtle ways, said co-author Liam of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, NC. \"Over time there were fewer distinct niches available each island,\" Revell. \"Ancient evolutionary changes in body proportions were large, but more recent evolutionary changes have more subtle.\" The researchers saw the same trend each island. \"The islands like Petri dishes where species diversification unfolded in similar ways,\" said Mahler. \"The species there the more they put the brakes on body evolution.\" The study sheds new light on how biodiversity comes to \"We're not looking at species number, we're also at how the shape of life changes over time,\" said Mahler.

It was created by activists who opposed the practice of experimenting on animals. The Roman Celsus claimed that in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE physicians had performed on sentenced criminals, but vivisection on humans was generally outlawed. Experimenters frequently used living animals. Most early modern researchers considered this practice acceptable, believing that animals felt no pain. Even those who opposed vivisection in the early modern period did not usually do so out of consideration for the animals, but they thought that this practice would coarsen the experimenter, or because they concerned that animals stressed under experimental conditions did represent the normal state body. Prompted by the rise of experimental physiology and the use of animals, an anti-vivisection movement started in the 1860s.

Moreover, the emitted light waves are coherent, that of the energy and troughs are precisely in step. Now, a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has demonstrated experimentally that cloud consisting of millions atoms can also be made coherent. Instead flying about and colliding randomly, the display acting as if the entire were a single entity. According to quantum mechanics, atoms can like waves. Thus, two overlapping clouds made up of atoms in states should a zebra-striped interference of and light fringes, just like those generated when two beams of ordinary laser light overlap. By detecting such a pattern, the researchers proved that the clouds' atoms are coherent and constitute \"atom laser,\" says physicist Wolfgang Ketterle, who heads the MIT group. These matter waves, in principle, can be focused just like Ketterle and his coworkers describe their observations in the Jan. Science. The demonstration of coherence involving large numbers of atoms is the latest in a series of studies of a remarkable state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate. Chilled to temperatures barely above absolute zero, theory predicted, the atoms would collectively enter same state and behave like a single unit, or superparticle, with a specific wavelength.

In effect, they manipulate the magnetic states of atoms to expel an adjustable fraction of original cloud; under the influence of gravity, the released clump falls. The method can produce a sequence descending with each containing 100,000 to several million coherent atoms. The apparatus acts like a dripping faucet, Ketterle says. He and his colleagues describe the in Jan. Physical Review Letters. To demonstrate interference, the MIT group created a double magnetic trap so that two pulses of coherent atoms could be released the time. clumps fell, they started to spread and The researchers could then observe interference between the atomic waves of the droplets. \"The signal was almost too good to be true,\" Ketterle says. \"We a high-contrast, very regular pattern.\" \"It's a beautiful result,\" Cornell remarks. \"This work really shows that Bose-Einstein condensation is atom From the pattern, the MIT researchers deduced that the condensate sodium atoms has a wavelength of about 30 micrometers, considerably than the 0.04-nanometer wavelength typical of individual at room Ketterle and colleagues are already planning several improvements to their primitive atom laser, getting more atoms the emitted pulses and going from pulses to a continuous beam. use of an atom laser the precision of atomic clocks and for manipulating atoms is still distant, however, Cornell notes.",

Raloff Canadian scientists have identified the likely culprit behind some historic, regional declines in salmon. The researchers find that a water can render migrating fish unable to survive a life at sea. Heavy, late-spring spraying forests with a laced with nonylphenol during the 1970s and '80s was the clue that led the biologists to unmask that chemical's role in the transitory decline of salmon East Canada. these have ended, concentrations of nonylphenols in forest runoff then were comparable to those in the effluent of some pulp mills, industrial facilities, and sewage-treatment plants today. Downstream of such areas, the scientists argue, salmon other migratory fish may still be at risk. are surfactants used in from pesticides to dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, plastics, and spermicides. Because waste-treatment don't remove well, these can build up in downstream waters (SN: 1/8/94, p. When British studies linked nonylphenol pollution to reproductive problems in fish (SN: 2/26/94, p. 142), Wayne L. of Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Moncton, New Brunswick, became concerned. recalled that an insecticide used forests for more than a decade had contained large amounts of nonylphenols. They helped aminocarb, oily active ingredient Matacil 1.8D, dissolve in water for easier spraying. Runoff of the pesticide during rains loaded the spawning and nursery waters of Atlantic salmon with nonylphenols. Moreover, this aerial spraying had tended to coincide with the stages of fish's transformation for life at To probe for effects of forest spraying, Fairchild and his colleagues surveyed than a decade river-by-river data on fish. They overlaid these numbers with archival data local aerial spraying with Matacil 1.8D or either of two nonylphenol-free pesticides. the same active ingredient, aminocarb, 1.8D does. Most the lowest adult salmon 1973 and 1990 occurred in rivers where smolts would earlier have encountered runoff 1.8D, Fairchild's group found. 9 of of Matacil 1.8D spraying for which they had good data, salmon returns were lower than they were within the 5 years earlier and 5 years later, report the May Environmental Health Perspectives. No population declines were with the two pesticides. The researchers have now smolts in the laboratory to various nonylphenol concentrations, including some typical of Canadian rivers during the 1970s. The fish remained healthyuntil they entered salt at which point they exhibited failure-to-thrive syndrome. \"They looked they were starving,\" Fairchild told Science News. Within 2 months, he notes, 20 to 30 percent died. Untreated smolts adjusted to salt water and fattened up. Steffen S. Madsen, a fish ecophysiologist at Odense University in Denmark, is not surprised, based on his own experiments. To move from fresh water to the sea, a fish undergo major hormonal changes adapt it for pumping out excess A female preparing to spawn fresh water must undergo the opposite change. Since estrogen triggers her adaptation, Madsen and a colleague decided to test how smolts would respond to estrogen or nonylphenol, estrogen mimic. In the lab, they periodically injected salmon smolts or nonylphenol over 30 days, and at points placed in seawater 24 hours. Salt in the fish's blood skyrocketed during the day-long trials, unlike salt in untreated smolts. \"Our preliminary evidence that natural and mental screw up the pituitary,\" Madsen says. The gland responds by making a hormone that drives freshwater adaptation. Judging by Fairchild's data, Madsen now suspects that any fish migrates between and salt water may be similarly vulnerable to high concentrations pollutants that mimic estrogen.

The first such was created by the atmospheric scientist and chemist, Sir James Lovelock, who developed his hypotheses in the 1960s before formally publishing the concept, first in the New Scientist (February 1975) and then in the 1979 book \"Quest for Gaia\". He hypothesized that the living matter of the planet functioned like a single organism and named this self-regulating living system after the Greek goddess, Gaia, using a suggestion of novelist William Gaia \"theories\" have non-technical predecessors in ideas of several cultures. Today, \"Gaia theory\" is sometimes used non-scientists to refer to hypotheses of a self-regulating Earth that are non-technical but take inspiration from scientific models. Among some scientists, \"Gaia\" carries connotations of lack scientific rigor, quasi-mystical thinking about the planet arth, and Lovelock's hypothesis was received initially with much antagonism by much of the scientific community. controversy exists, however, that life and the physical environment significantly influence one another. theory today is a spectrum of ranging from the Gaia) to the (Strong Gaia). At one end of this spectrum is the undeniable that organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is self-organizing system, which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of meta-equilibrium is broadly conducive to life. The history evolution, ecology and climate show that the exact characteristics of this equilibrium intermittently have undergone changes, which are believed to have caused extinctions and felled civilisations. and earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a as an emergent property or entelechy of the system; as each individual pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes point to examples of actions have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a environment to an oxygen-rich one. However, proponents point out that those atmospheric created an environment even more suitable to life. Some go a step further and hypothesize that all lifeforms are part of a single living planetary being called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, seas and the terrestrial crust would results of interventions carried out by Gaia the coevolving diversity of living organisms. While it is arguable that the Earth as unit does not match the generally accepted biological criteria for life itself has not yet reproduced, for instance), many scientists would be comfortable characterising the earth as a single \"system\". The most extreme form of Gaia is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism; in this view the Earth's biosphere is consciously manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis.

Partly, this is due to a stubborn aversion to the that normal, regular people rape, murder, or molest children (Barlow, 1990). there is a desire for simple, straightforward answers (Bartol, 1991). Generally, theorists to put together the puzzle of the human personality. Temperament the used for the childhood counterpart to personality (Farrington & Jolliffe, 2004). personality or temperament, are combined together into traits or broad dimension of personality. traits are persisting underlying tendencies in certain ways in particular situations (Farrington & Jolliffe, 2004). Traits shape emotional and experiential spheres of life, defining how people perceive their world and predict physical psychological (Roberts, Various models of personality exist, with a set of traits and super traits (Miller & Lynam, 2001). Personality and have been linked in two general ways. First, in “personality-trait psychology” & Sellers, 2009, p. 74) certain traits or traits within structured model of personality may be linked antisocial behavior (ASB).1 As reviewed by Miller and Lynam (2001), four structured models of personality theory were found to be used in criminological research are considered reliable: the five-factor model (FFM; & Costa, 1990), PEN model (Eysenck, 1977), Tellegen’s three-factor (1985), Cloninger’s temperament and character model (Cloninger, Dragan, Svraki, Przybeck, 1993). Table the traits of these models are listed and Eysenck hypothesized specific associations between the PEN model and ASB, proposing the typical criminal would possess high levels of all three of his personality dimensions. Cloninger hypothesized a link between ASB and personality dimensions from his model, stating that ASB be to seeking, harm avoidance, and low reward dependence (see Table 1). The second way that personality theorists have linked personality to crime is through “personality-type psychology” (Akers & Sellers, 2009, p. 74) or by asserting that certain abnormal individuals possess a criminal personality, labeled or antisocial. complex and twisting history of the term and concept of psychopathy can be traced back to the early 1800s (Feeney, 2003), contributing to its common misuse by academics and nonacademics.2 Hare (1993, 1996) set forth a psychological schematic of persistent who possess certain dysfunctional interpersonal, behavioral and make up about one percentage the population. The interpersonal and affective characteristic of psychopaths is the dual possession of absolute self-centeredness, grandiosity, callousness, and lack of remorse or empathy for others coupled with a charismatic, charming, and manipulative superficiality (Hare, 1993). The defining behavioral characteristics of psychopaths impulsivity, irresponsibility, risk taking, and antisocial behavior (Hare, 1993). Table 2 displays the emotional, interpersonal, and acts of social deviance hypothesized to indicate psychopathy. The term antisocial, not psychopath or sociopath, is now used by the American Association the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). This disorder itself as a persistent disregard and violation of the rights of others, beginning at an early age and persisting into adulthood. The DSM-IV-TR the antisocial personality disorder as broader clinical disorder than a diagnosis that could easily be to many engage criminal behavior (see Table 2). Related to Theoretical Propositions Policy Implications Certain personality such as Eysenck (1977) postulated that personality traits stem from biological For example, Eysenck noted that arousal levels are directly associated with the personality trait of extraversion (Eysenck, 1977) and testosterone are linked to levels of psychotocism (Eysenck, 1997). The biologically deterministic premise postulated within segments of personality theory sparked an intense debate in criminology (Andrews & Wormith, 1989; Gibbons, 1989), which provides just a glimpse a chasm in the field of criminology that has been rupturing for decades. Criticisms against deterministic thought best be understood within the historical context (Hirschi & Hindelang, 1977; Laub & Sampson, 1991; Rafter, 2006). Criminology is a",

He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion structure. Among other things he noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by de Saussure.

Most population-based promotion activities are primary measures. - Secondary prevention activities are aimed at early disease detection, thereby increasing opportunities for interventions to prevent progression of the disease and emergence symptoms. - Tertiary prevention reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. - Quaternary prevention is the set of health activities that mitigate or avoid the consequences of unnecessary or excessive interventions in the health system. Simple examples preventive medicine include hand and immunizations. Preventive care may include examinations and screening tests tailored an age, health, family For example, a person with a family history of certain cancers or diseases would begin at an earlier age and/or more frequently than those with no family history. On the other side of preventive medicine, some non-profit organizations, such as the Northern California Cancer Center, apply epidemiological research towards finding ways prevent diseases. Universal, and indicated Gordon (1987) in area of disease and later and Baxley in the area of substance use proposed a three-tiered preventive intervention classification system: universal, selective, and indicated prevention. Amongst others, this typology has gained favour and is used by the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the NIDA and European for Drugs and Drug Addiction. addresses the entire population (national, local community, school, and aim to prevent or delay the abuse of tobacco, and other drugs. All individuals, without screening, provided with information and skills necessary the problem. Selective prevention focuses on groups whose risk of of abuse or dependence is above average. The subgroups may distinguished characteristics such as age, gender, family history, or economic status. For example, drug campaigns in recreational settings. Indicated prevention involves a screening process, and to identify individuals who exhibit signs substance abuse and other problem behaviours. Identifiers include falling grades among students, known problem consumption or conduct disorders, alienation from parents, school, and positive peer groups etc. Outside the scope of this model is environmental prevention. prevention approaches are typically managed the regulatory or community level, and focus on interventions to deter drug consumption. Prohibition and bans (e.g. smoking workplace bans, alcohol advertising bans) may be the ultimate environmental restriction. However, in practice environmental preventions programmes embrace various initiatives at the and micro level, from government monopolies for sales, through roadside sobriety or drug tests, worker/pupil/student drug testing, in sensitive settings (near schools, at rock festivals), and legislative guidelines aimed at precipitating (warnings, penalties, fines). Professionals involved in public health aspect of this practice may be involved in entomology, pest control, and public health inspections. Public inspections can include waters, pools, beaches, food preparation and serving, and industrial inspections and surveys. In the United States, preventive medicine is a medical specialty, one of the 24 recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). It encompasses three areas of specialization: - General preventive and public health - Aerospace medicine - Occupational medicine In order to become board-certified in one of the preventive areas of specialization, a licensed U.S. physician (M.D. or D.O.) must successfully complete a preventive medicine medical residency program a one-year internship. Following that, the must complete a year of in area and pass the preventive medicine board examination.

When water is poured through filter, the charcoal removes chlorine, chemicals and some other contaminants the filters out any larger particles. The result is clear looking and clean tasting water. filtration of outdoor water when camping and backpacking, a portable reverse system is one option. Reverse osmosis purifies water by passing it through a semi-permeable membrane, which traps nearly of all contaminants, both chemical and biological. Since biological contaminants as bacteria and are a major threat in rivers and lakes, is important to have a filter that is able to safely remove them. disadvantage of reverse osmosis is that the is extremely slow and wastes a lot of water. A reverse osmosis filter can also a valuable part of any emergency supply because contaminated water is a common encountered in emergency situations. Because reverse osmosis is capable of even removing viruses from this type of filter save lives countries where there is an extreme shortage of safe drinking water. Another one of the more popular types of water filter is the ceramic microfilter. Like a reverse osmosis system, ceramic filtration system also uses an ultra-fine to the water. In this case, porous ceramic is used as a filter. The ceramic is fine enough to trap even most bacteria and some types of virus, so they successfully purify water in most parts of the world.

Asthma, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and even depression have been linked to a constant activation of the inflammatory response. It’s not an easy condition to treat, either, its causes include obesity, stress, and pollution, among others. As a result, Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, Ph.D., the Webb Endowed Chair of Nutrition and many other UAB researchers are investigating ways to control inflammation on an individual basis. not the only ones searching for solution. Several celebrities have been touting “anti-inflammatory” diets as a cure. These diets call for eating lots of fruits and vegetables, decreasing consumption of processed carbohydrates, replacing fats and containing omega-6 with their omega-3 counterparts as fish, and using olive oil instead of other oils. Logic and Loss It’s logical: If inflammation causes certain diseases, then eating foods that combat inflammation should prevent those diseases. But according Demark-Wahnefried, popular “anti-inflammatory” diets missing one critical factor: weight control. “We know adipose tissue (body has a deal to do with inflammation,” she says. “It produces all of cytokines and adipokines, which are signaling molecules that drive inflammation.” “It’s all spin,” Demark-Wahnefried. “What they seem to be preaching is pretty much mainstream. just repackaged it.” The bright side is changes in eating habits can lead to weight loss, producing health benefits. a 7 reduction body diminishes the of diseases diabetes and cancer, Demark-Wahnefried says. This doesn’t necessarily depend on the diet used, though. She points out even the Atkins diet—the antithesis of an “anti-inflammatory” diet—can lead to clinical health if it results in weight loss. for antioxidant supplements, studies suggest that there is no shortcut. Just adding an antioxidant supplement two will not overcome all the inflammatory effects of the traditional Southern biscuits-and-gravy diet, for example. In fact, when it comes to research on isolated supplements, “we’ve really bombed out at being able predict the benefit will be,” says Demark-Wahnefried. “The more you the from the whole food, the more danger you have of not having the right isoform the appropriate mix. You lose a lot the benefit of the whole food when you have that reductionist mentality.” So, to reduce inflammation, recommends losing the extra pounds to reduce adipose stores, then following up with an overall healthier diet. She suggests consuming more fruits and vegetables and replacing unhealthy proteins with those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish. Sounds a lot like an “anti-inflammatory” diet, right? “It’s all spin,” she “What they seem to be preaching is much mainstream. They’ve just repackaged it.” A Primer on Produce Fresh fruits and are best for nutritional value—“as long as Demark-Wahnefried notes. She explains many fruits and sold in stores are picked before their nutrients are at peak and more nutrients are lost during the long transit. In other words, buy local possible. Canned fruits and vegetables can provide some nutrients, too, but the heat of the canning process can some, which are known as heat-labile nutrients. “A lot of B up in smoke, and vitamin C and anything that is water-soluble is diminished,” Demark-Wahnefried says. Heat-labile nutrients are also lost in dried fruits, but soluble fiber (especially good for cholesterol levels) and many nutrients like magnesium and iron are maintained. One caveat: Dried fruit tastes good, so likely eat more. “It’s a substantial calorie load,” she warns. As for cooking, “there’s certain wisdom to things raw; you don’t destroy the nutrients that are heat-labile,” explains. “But by the same token, are substances in food that, when them, actually have a benefit for you.” She recommends vegetables in the microwave, which introduces the least amount of vitamin-leeching water and requires a shorter cooking time.

The study involved 230 people in poor, urban neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Richmond, Oakland and Berkeley. Contacted by phone about once a month, half of them received specific dietary guidance and lifestyle counseling. After six months, those who had received the counseling had on average lost more were consuming less fat, were eating more fruits and vegetables and showed more improvements in lowering in their a key risk measure for type diabetes. Described this week in the American Journal of Public Health, the intervention is specifically designed for urban, poor, predominantly minority communities. It addresses need for diabetes prevention interventions in these communities and highlights a simple fact that doctors and elsewhere have repeating for years — that type 2 diabetes is preventable in first place. “Diabetes is not something you are necessarily going to get just because it runs in your family,” said Alka Kanaya, MD, associate professor of UCSF and one of two senior authors on study. very preventable, and lifestyle changes can really impact the onset of diabetes.” “You can do something about said Anita PhD, a professor at the UCSF Institute Health & Aging and Center for Aging in Diverse Communities who is the other senior author on the paper. How Lifestyle Changes Can Prevent Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic and complex disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood that arise due to problems with hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. It is usually caused by an inability insulin (type 1) or an inability to respond correctly to insulin (type 2). A major health concern in the United States, diabetes of types affect an estimated 8.3 percent of the population — some 25.8 million Americans — and cost U.S. more $200 billion annually. In California an estimated 4 million people (one of every seven adults) type 2 diabetes and millions more are at risk of developing it. These numbers are poised to explode in the next half if more is done to prevent diabetes. Previous studies have shown that counseling and other lifestyle interventions are effective at preventing type 2 diabetes, but those interventions have designed for clinical settings and include separate sessions with numerous health professionals. This makes them expensive difficult scale to large urban populations where are needed the most. Many this country’s urban poor face thin health insurance coverage, low literacy, and low income, and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These disparities were apparent in the UCSF study. About half study population was of immigrants, nearly a quarter had no health insurance. Almost a said they faced financial hardship, and 22 percent had less than education. By focusing on a phone-based solution delivered by Public Health department staff, the UCSF researchers designed their new intervention specifically as a low-cost community-based approach that would be relevant to poor, minority and low-literacy populations. Similar telephone interventions have used to reach out broadly to populations San and in cities to spread messages related hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol and other issues. “This adds to our public health toolkit of ways to do outreach and prevent diabetes,” said Kanaya.

Over days, delegates from 112 countries—including 25 000 youth and representatives from government, civil society and the United Nations—shared ideas on young people’s involvement in achieving Millennium Goals (MDGs). With an estimated 40% of new HIV infections occurring among people aged 15-24, a youth-centered approach the AIDS response will be critical to meet MDG 6—halting and reversing the spread of HIV—and to ensure efforts are sustained in the long term. In a video message to young delegates, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé said young people had the power to shape a future with zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. “Each you is driving force for change and development in your own countries,” he said. “Together you are an incredible movement that is shaping future of the world.” the 33.4 million people living with HIV worldwide, some 5 million are young people. An estimated 2500 young become newly infected with HIV each day. The epidemic has taken a particularly devastating toll on the lives of young women, who account for 66% of youth worldwide. Empowering young to protect themselves from HIV represents one of UNAIDS’ ten priority areas, with the overall goal of a 30% reduction in new HIV infections by 2015. At joint workshop on HIV and young people, UNAIDS and UNFPA introduced a new “business case” successes to date in the HIV response among youth and areas for improvement. Through the workshop, young were invited to offer their perspectives on the relevance and application of the business case at the national level. Evidence-based information and HIV including sexual and reproductive health, were highlighted as critical to reducing infection among young people. Many participants voiced concern reaching young people HIV prevention messages. we are still and exploring, we may get into risky behaviors,” said Gastelum, a youth participant from Mexico who attended the workshop. information on is the first step—that will protect us.” Less than 40% of young men and women have access to accurate about HIV transmission—far short of the 95% target set in the UNGASS of Commitment for the year 2010. In developing China, only 30% of young men and 19% young women benefit from information on HIV. Despite challenges, there are signs of progress. A new study from UNAIDS has reported more than 25% in HIV prevalence among young people in 15 countries heavily affected by the AIDS epidemic. “Simply young people are leading a prevention revolution over the globe,” said Dr. César Nunez, of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Latin America, in a session at the conference. “The empowerment of young people has led to changes in sexual behavior. Young people are choosing to sex later, with fewer partners, and they are using condoms.” Earlier this month, UN launched International of Youth, an initiative designed to increase youth participation in global development issues and enhance inter-cultural dialogue and understanding across generations. a launch event in York City, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged young people across the world to look beyond the borders of own countries: “Engage with the world.

Coincidentally this time corresponds to the time takes for Earth to rotate one revolution which is just under 24 hours. Sidereal time not like solar which is measured by the movement of the sun. Or the lunar cycles which take about 28 days. It is the relative angle of a celestial object to the prime meridian of the vernal equinox of the earth. IF these terms are here is what they mean.

In a rainwater harvesting system, rain is from a building rooftop other source and is held in containers for future use, such as watering gardens or washing cars. This practice reduces the demand water resources and excellent during times of drought. is it Important? In addition to reducing the demand on our water (especially important during drought), harvesting also helps prevent water pollution. Surprised? Here’s why: the of the Clean Water has meant that the greatest threat to New York’s waterbodies comes not from industrial sources, but rather through the small actions all make in daily For example, a rain storm, oil, pesticides, animal waste, and litter from our lawns, sidewalks, driveways, and streets are washed down into our sewers. This is called non-point (NPS) pollution because the pollutants come from too many sources to be identified. Rainwater harvesting water from becoming polluted stormwater; instead, this captured rainwater may be used to irrigate gardens near where it falls. In New York City, keeping rainwater out of the sewer system is very important. That’s because the city has an old sewer system that uses the same pipes to transport household waste stormwater to treatment plants. During heavy rains, the overloads; then untreated sewage and contaminated stormwater overflow into rivers and estuary, serious consequences: is Harvesting Rainwater in New York City? Back in 2002, a emergency pushed many community to the brink of extinction. For the first in years, community gardeners were denied permission to use fire hydrants, the source of water for community This crisis led to the formation of the Water Resources Group (WRG), an open collaboration of community gardening and environmental organizations. With help from the WRG, rainwater harvesting systems have now been built as demonstration sites in twenty NYC community gardens. At community harvest rainwater, rain diverted the gutters of adjacent buildings and is stored in tanks in the gardens. A 1-inch rainfall on a 1,000-square-foot roof produces 600 gallons of water. The tanks are mosquito proof, so standing water does not encourage West Nile virus. Because rainwater is chlorine free, it is than water for plant growth, meaning healthier plants. And it’s free! What are Other Cities Doing? Many cities have creative, low-cost ways to stop wasting rainwater by diverting from their sewage systems and putting to use where it falls. Here are some examples: What Can I Do? Spread the word! Educate those around you on the importance of lifestyle Tell people to litter, dump oil down storm drains, or overfertilize their lawns. Install rainwater harvesting system at your home, school, business, local community center. Contact your local elected officials, and let them know you support rainwater harvesting!

Dr. Houghton, who interviewed the Ojibwe about epidemics in 1832, wrote down their recollection that in 1770, when visiting Mackinac, cask of liquor and a closely rolled were presented to the Indians a token of friendship. They were at the same time strictly enjoined neither to break the seal of cask to unroll the flag, until they had heart of their own country. \"This they promised to observe; but while returning, and after having many days, the chief of deputation made a feast for the Indians of the band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, which occasion he unsealed the cask unrolled the the gratification of his guests... and of Indians then Fond du Lac, about three hundred in number, nearly the whole were swept off by it.

Each of these services can be bound or unbound at any time and as needed. [Jamil08]However, as defined, SOA has a loosely-coupled feature, which makes open the challenges of security. It means that SOA must meet several requirements. The main requirements are as follows[Candolin07]: service discovery, service authentication, access confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. To security in a loosely-coupled SOA the open standards communities that created Web services developed number of security for Web services which one of the most active and widely adopted implementation of SOA. Figure 1 depicts a notional reference model for Web services security standards. This reference model maps the different standards to the different functional layers of a typical Web service implementation. As described above, in the Web Services Security Stack the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) are the standard for access control which means that when service is requested by a user the service must enforce the specified policy to access control. focus on access in Web Services and represent what SAML XACML are, how work and where they able to be applied together. SAML, created by the Security Services Committee of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), a an XML-based framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. As its name suggests, SAML allows business entities to make assertions regarding the identity, attributes, entitlements of a subject (an entity that is often a human user) to other entities, such partner company or another enterprise [Madsen05] SAML is a flexible and extensible protocol designed to be used - and customized if necessary - by other standards.

SAML enables web the communication of an authentication assertion from the first site to the second which, if confident of the of the assertion, choose to log in user as they had authenticated directly. A principal authenticates at the identity provider and is subsequently recognized (and given corresponding access/service) at the service provider.[Google] For example, Google made SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) Service for Google Apps.

Similar to the Web SSO scenario, the authorization has one web site communicating identity information about a subject to another web in support of some identity information may be characteristic of the subject (such as a person's role in a B2B scenario) rather than, addition to, information about when how the person was authenticated.

Types of energy Electricity is the main energy source in homes. In 2007-08, about (49%) of the energy used by households was sourced from electricity. Household electricity consumption rose to 210 petajoules (PJ) in 2007-08, up 48% from 1990-91 (ABARE, 2009). In March 2008, electricity the primary source throughout Australia for cooking (three-quarters of ovens used electricity and more than half (56%) of and for hot water systems (46%). There has been fall in the use of electricity for hot water systems between 2002 and from 61% to 46%. Of those homes with heaters, electricity was the main source of for space heating (45%), by gas (41% for mains gas and LPG/bottled together) and wood (13%). Natural gas is the second most common source of energy used in the used by more than six in ten households (61%) in 2008. In total, households used 137 PJ of natural gas in 2007-08, equivalent to almost a third (32%) of total household energy use (ABARE, 2009). almost one in three Australian households (31%), gas (mains or LPG/bottled) was the main source of energy for space heating and 37% used gas for hot water In the main gas-producing states of Victoria and Western Australia, was used as an energy source in nine out households (90% and 87% respectively, compared with six out of ten households nationally). Used primarily as a source of heating, wood use by households has declined 26% in the 10 years, from 82 PJ in to 60 PJ in 2007-08 (ABARE, 2009). In 2008, 13% of Australian households used wood a source of energy in the home. More than one-third (35%) households in Tasmania used wood as an energy source, a more than (52%) in 2002 (graph 2.41).

A range of government grants and rebates have been made available to households recent to encourage people to use solar energy in the home. In 2008, 7% of used solar energy to heat water, up from 4% of households in 2005. More than half of all households in the Northern Territory used solar energy to heat water (54%) - a much larger proportion than in Western Australia (21%) and no other state or territory exceeded (graph 2.42). provides option people to pay a for electricity generated from renewable is fed into the national power grid.

By March 2009, just over 984,000 households were paying for up from 132,300 customers in 2005 (End note 8). There has also been an increase in the awareness of GreenPower products in the past decade. In 1999, less than one-fifth (19%) of households were aware of GreenPower. Nearly a decade later, had risen to more than half (52%) of all households in including 5% who that they were already paying GreenPower.

Many were Japanese immigrants, jammed in structures controlled by Chinese landlords, who in turn paid Hawaiian and haole landowners. And Chinatown had become the center of another kind of Asian-controlled business as well. The census taken in December 1899 revealed the area was brimming with organized prostitution, a niche business that provided economic entre for new immigrants. In 1900, 84 percent of known prostitutes in Honolulu were and nearly 100 percent of the pimps were Japanese. Despite the filthy squalor of living conditions, and the disdain which Chinatown was viewed by rest of Honolulu, it was an economic engine, pumping money into the pockets of landowners like Bishop Estate. At a time when a plantation worker made about $18 a month, Japanese prostitutes were making hundreds of dollars . Although maintaining the status quo was lucrative, the overcrowded living conditions in Chinatown, coupled with a complete lack urban planning the area, created a neighborhood that ran with rats and insects, that had sewage and garbage lying unattended in the streets.

If an internal link led you here, you may wish to change the link point directly to the intended article. A machine is a tool consisting of one more that is constructed to a particular goal. Machines are powered devices, usually chemically, thermally or electrically powered, and frequently motorized. Historically, a device required parts to classify as a machine; however, the advent of electronics technology led to development of devices without moving parts that are machines. The word \"machine\" is derived from the Latin word machina, which in turn derives from the Doric μαχανά (machana), Ionic Greek μηχανή \"contrivance, machine, engine\" and that μῆχος (mechos), \"means, expedient, remedy\". The meaning of machine is traced by the Oxford English to an independently functioning structure and by Merriam-Webster Dictionary to something that has been constructed. This includes human design into the meaning of machine. A simple is a device that simply transforms the direction or magnitude of a but a large number of more complex machines exist. Examples include electronic systems, molecular machines, computers, television radio. requires Perhaps first example of a human made device designed to manage power is the hand axe, made by chipping flint to form a wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral and movement of tool into transverse splitting force movement of the workpiece. idea of a \"simple originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the century BC, who studied the \"Archimedean\" simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. He discovered the principle of advantage in the lever. Later Greek defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able roughly calculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandria (ca. AD) in his work Mechanics lists five mechanisms that can \"set load in motion\"; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However the Greeks' was limited to the statics of simple machines; the balance of forces, did not include dynamics; tradeoff between force and distance, or the concept of work. During the Renaissance the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how much work they could perform, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 Le Meccaniche (\"On Mechanics\"). He was first understand that simple machines do not create only transform it. The classic rules of sliding friction in machines by Leonardo Vinci (1452–1519), but remained unpublished in his notebooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). |Simple machines||Inclined plane, Wheel and axle, Lever, Pulley, Wedge, Screw| |Mechanical components||Axle, Bearings, Bucket, Fastener, Gear, Key, Link Rack and pinion, Roller chains, Rope, Seals, Spring, Wheel| |Clock||Atomic clock, Chronometer, Pendulum clock, Quartz clock| |Compressors and Pumps||Archimedes' screw, pump, Hydraulic Pump, Trompe, Vacuum pump| |Heat engines||External engines||Steam engine, Stirling engine| |Internal combustion engines||Reciprocating engine, turbine| |Heat pumps||Absorption refrigerator, Thermoelectric refrigerator, cooling| |Linkages||Pantograph, Cam, Peaucellier-Lipkin| |Turbine||Gas Jet engine, Steam turbine, Water turbine, Wind generator, Windmill| |Aerofoil||Sail, Wing, Rudder, Flap, Propeller| |Electronic devices||Vacuum tube, Transistor, Diode, Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Memristor, Semiconductor, Computer| |Robots||Actuator, Servo, Servomechanism, Stepper motor, Computer| |Miscellaneous||Vending machine, Wind tunnel, Check weighing machines, Riveting machines| The idea that a machine can be broken down into simple elements led to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines.

Of course kids will foods if that's what they're offered; these are manufactured to taste good, and most kids aren't to opt for a spear of over French fry -- until they're old enough to understand the implications of the and assuming you have taught them the importance of healthy foods along the way. In many ways society is set up against you on this one. The Interagency Working on Marketed to Children (IWG) reports: - The fast-food industry spends more than $5 million every day marketing unhealthy to children. - Kids watch an average of over 10 food-related ads every day (nearly 4,000/year). - Nearly all (98 percent) food advertisements viewed by children are for products that are high in fat, sugar or sodium. Most (79 percent) are low in So even under the best circumstances, your kids will probably be exposed to latest kid foods, and this is what marketers are on.

Actually, Machu Picchu was not a city at all. was probably built by Pachacuti Inca as a royal estate and religious retreat in 1460-70. Its location—on a remote secondary road in nearly impassable terrain high above the River canyon cloud forest—almost ensured that it would have no administrative, commercial or military use. Any movement in that direction to or from Cusco and the valley upriver would have by other roads, either the high road Salcantay or the Lucumayo valley road. Travel was restricted on these roads except by Inca decree. After Pachacuti Inca's death, Machu Picchu remained the property of his or kinship group, who were responsible for maintenance, administration and continued building. an extraordinary sacred site (location as well as it surely was visited Topa Inca and the last great ruler, Huayna Capac, although each in turn built own estates and palaces.

Machu Picchu, like most Inca sites undergoing constant construction and must of had a crew of builders as well as planters, and others. So in order to really how Machu Picchu remained a secret, it's necessary to understand how Inca culture constricted travel and information. The Inca were a completely ordered an regimented society. Although great numbers of people moved around corporate state projects and resettlement, once at a location, they didn't move. The royal roads were reserved for official travel.

We know from historical writing and the archaeological record that the Incas did not possess a written language, although, must have used some symbols and perhaps diagrams. We also know that the Quipu (collection of colored strings and knots) was extensively used for accounting and record keeping. But Quipus need highly trained interpreters to read and the Spanish were unable to locate or even one of these specialists. The also maintained a class or guild of verbal historians. But with the catastrophic collapse of Inca state structure following the Spanish, these historians were scattered and forgotten. But Machu Picchu was mostly forgotten even before the Spanish came. Small pox was the conquistadores' advance guard. Huayna Capac and an estimated 50 percent of population died of small pox sometime around 1527. Inca government suffered, and after a period of turmoil, the empire fell into civil war over Inca secession. Machu Picchu was probably abandoned at this time—both because was expensive to maintain with most of the population dead from war or epidemic, it was hard find labor to keep it up.

Not only that, we live in a society that discourages, in so many ways, thinking for ourselves. We defer so readily to opinion, fashion, and what the say and the studies show. Most studies that show stuff have a lot more one author. Most books that change our lives have only one, and we don't live in a time when many are being written. Just about every good play or novel or painting, of course, has its source in the vision of a single artist. We also see, of course, that in the disciplines that require deep thought and personal interpretation (such as philosophy—especially political philosophy—and history), articles only have author.

They would also be shy about being too or \"erotic\" about what they've read to others who just didn't work as hard or care as much as they (All this is why I can't stand \"peer review\" as even a stage in evaluating student papers.)

An unfolding story that Chinese me, be a turning point conservation and wild protection in China.” On Sunday 11 November people discovered many sick and ORIENTAL (Ciconia boyciana) at Beidagang Reservoir, Tianjin (just 30 mins from Beijing by train). These globally endangered birds - with a restricted range East Asia – had been poisoned illegally by poachers using a chemical called carbofuran that, although banned in the EU, Canada and other countries, is commonly available and used, legitimately, as a pesticide all over China. The storks were possibly unintended victims of well-organised and, sadly, all-too poaching activity intended to catch ducks and geese for restaurant trade. Carbofuran is mixed with cereal, or given to fish in small man-made pools. Birds lose consciousness after eating the bait, are caught by hand and injected with an antidote. The victims are then shipped – usually alive – to restaurants, primarily in southern China. The demand for wild birds is high and they are sold a delicacy, with many consumers, particularly in southern cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, believing that wild birds taste better than produce, and they are prepared to pay premium. A wild goose or swan can fetch several hundred Yuan (100 Yuan = 10 GBP). The business is highly profitable. The scale of activity in China, and the range of used by poachers to wild birds, are covered in an excellent, but sobering, article in most recent of Goose Bulletin. authors estimate that between and swans and geese are caught illegally in China for the restaurant trade every year. So what makes the recent case involving Oriental Storks at Beidagang such a big deal? The answer is the incredible public reaction, led by local people and driven by social media. The unfolding at Beidagang, although desperately could have been much worse were it not for some dedicated and brave individuals. Local birders, with volunteers, officials from the Forestry Administration, police and even firemen have working together help catch, treat care for these birds. They have set up 24/7 patrols to deter the poachers. All of this been transmitted on social media and the coverage gone viral. The Chinese service, Weibo, has over 500 million users (on a par with global membership on Twitter) and activists have been regular updates that have been ‘re-tweeted’ by growing band followers. As I write this post, the latest update been over 900 times to more than a million users in less than one hour. This leading the traditional print and visual media. we are seeing articles relating to this poisoning incident in Chinese and English language media, both local national. All of a outcry against the illegal trapping and hunting of wild birds China, also led by social media. Three weeks ago a brave undercover journalist released a shocking video about using spotlights to confuse migrants in before gunning them out of the sky. The Chinese outraged and Weibo was alive with condemnation of the hunters criticism of the authorities being to act. Shortly after this major local birders discovered over 2km of illegal mist nets at Beidagang, site of the current Oriental Stork tragedy. Local activists, of whom are now on site trying to save storks, led a ‘day of action’ over 60 volunteers, even the Chinese army, to take down illegal mist nets in the reedbed. This was by local and national TV as well as print media. Due to these two the number of articles relating to illegal trapping and nationwide has exploded. The campaign to eradicate the illegal hunting of birds is gaining momentum. And the scale the reaction by ordinary Chinese people all over the country overwhelming, demonstrating clearly that the vast majority of Chinese care deeply about their wild birds. It will be hard for authorities to ignore. None of this would be happening without the incredible passion and energy of a small of volunteers at There are many people involved but a special mention must go to Xunqiang Mo (aka “Nemo”), a local student, Jingsheng who have personally the effort to cut down the illegal nets and are now leading ongoing to save the Oriental They are heroes in a personal account yesterday evening, provided by Zhu Lei, a Beijing-based birder monitoring the situation: “There is heart-breaking news. 8 more storks been found today, which raise the number up to 21 ! ground team located 3 evidently man-made small water pools (around diame",

The disease model, as far as I can tell, first gained traction as an idea in the 1930s with formation of Alcoholics Anonymous. Groups similar to AA, such as the and the Oxford cofounder Bill Wilson attended before his own voluntary fellowship) had existed prior to AA's formation, but AA took off in way they never did, for a variety of reasons. wasn't recognized as a disease by medical and psychiatric associations until the 1950s – but the now pretty firmly entrenched in of chemical dependency. Personally, I don't think an accident that AA was formed just a years after Prohibition ended. formation represented a fundamental cultural shift that the sale alcohol had not solved any of the problems that Temperance leaders, including the way problem drinking affected families. It still prescribed total from alcohol, just not for the entire population. And while Temperance leaders placed more of the blame for problem drinking on alcohol itself and the people who sold it – than on the heavy drinking was still viewed as a moral failure rather than a medical problem. In the decades after the advent AA, many cities' against were thrown or softened, and instead of being thrown into drunk tanks, people found stumbling around sleeping it off in public spaces were taken detox and facilities – a problematic policy shift in itself since people who aren't ready for rehab won't from it but still, a change for the better. All of that resulted from a movement that has attempted to make addiction a morally neutral, medical issue and has argued for treating people with addiction issues with rather than dismissive contempt. But our understanding addiction, through the disease lens, has evolved in odd ways. (It occurs to me, for instance, that if recovery programs don't necessarily view addiction as a moral problem, they promote a faith-based – and therefore “moral,” in some sense – In the 1980s, researchers began investigating a potential link between addiction and genetics – and almost immediately started talking about whether genetics would explain why some races or nationalities had higher incidences of problem drinking than others. Again, it was offered as a morally alternative to existing stereotypes about weak-willed, shiftless or mean drunks, particularly those in certain minority groups (Native and to a much, much, lesser Irish-Americans). Brown University epidemiologist Stephen Buka, in a paper discussing health disparities as they relate to substance abuse, notes that there is greater genetic variability within major racial groups than between them and that racial disparities in Research on ethnicity and race relate to heavy drinking is intrinsically problematic, not impossible to conduct, because these are plastic that change with society; discussions about the ethnic connection to drinking invariably all native Americans (on both continents) into one single category; in the same discussions, the Irish are presented as genetically distinct all other European ethnicities. same way that psychology at least, bad reporting on evolutionary research) often conveniently reinforces stereotypes about the role of men and women in the 21st society, genetic explanations for alcoholism tend to reinforce preexisting stereotypes about certain ethnic groups and races – in the case of both Native Americans and (now fully assimilated, but still cheekily stereotyped) Irish-Americans, these are stereotypes that date back centuries before the discovery of DNA; stories about the purported habits of Native Americans date back to the first interactions between white explorers and natives, with the former presenting own drinking norms refined and in control. Socioogist and social worker Richard Thatcher, author of the 2004 book Fighting Firewater Fictions: Moving Beyond the Disease Model of Alcoholism, argues that both the disease model and the “firewater myth” only cast American people the most essentialist but considers problem drinking from the social, cultural and economic realities with which many indigenous cope – a racist status quo and leading many young people to believe will eventually, inevitably become alcoholics themselves. That becomes a self-fulfilling particularly in cultures (Thatcher's work focuses on indigenous people in Cana",

As you most likely know, fiscal cliff is the name given to event associated the simultaneous expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, the increase in the payroll tax and the immediate reduction of federal government spending. For reference, here are links to APMEX’s special reports the cliff. Fiscal Cliff is but the Beginning While the sudden significant impact multiple changes in the economy is surely anxiety and uncertainty in both the personal lives and business of Americans, this likely only the beginning of issues as the United States begins respond to the “new normal” the Great However, the next increase in the federal debt ceiling – the maximum amount the U.S. may borrow as set by Congress – will establish the maximum U.S. Federal about trillion. While is, of course, a huge level of debt and the debt of any country, the U.S. also has the world’s largest economy. The question that each country must address is “How debt can this country afford?” answer depends on number of factors and is often measured in the ratio of debt to Gross Product the borrowing country. Historically, for the U.S., this ratio has generally been between 30 percent and 65 percent, from 1950 until the beginning of the Great in 2008. Debt is at High and Dangerous Levels When the next debt ceiling is set by Congress, most likely 2013, presuming borrowing to the ceiling low GDP growth, the U.S. Debt U.S. GDP ratio will most likely be percent, level more than double the levels since 1950. How does this compare to other countries? Below is a table of several key countries around world. Also, here is a complete list of countries with Debt to GDP levels provided by the International Monetary Fund. The History and the Current Status of the U.S. Debt During World War in 1917, the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring Congressional approval on the aggregate debt outstanding of the United States. Prior to this, Congress was required approve each every offering. Since 1950, there have 95 changes to the debt ceiling; since 2000 there have been 13 changes, or about one per year. You can read about the History of the U.S. Ceiling or see listing of all to the U.S. Debt Ceiling, use Table 7.3. Since the increases in the U.S. Debt Ceiling have been larger than in previous years as the United States borrowed more to finance the 2000 dot-com the in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Federal support of the Recession 2007–2008. The current status of the U.S. Public Debt and the Debt Limit is shown in the charts below. The U.S. Debt has increased by more than 15 percent since January 2011. The current U.S. Debt is very to the U.S. Debt Ceiling of about $16.5 trillion and, accordingly, will be required to take action soon. The U.S. Debt has increased $2.1 trillion, or about 15percent, two years since January 2011. the large increase, the Federal Government has almost borrowed to the limit. The U.S. Debt Ceiling must be raised in the very near future, most in a few months. the chart below shows, at the end of October only about $172 billion remained available under the U.S. Debt Ceiling. In November 2011, federal borrowing increased by $119 and if that the rate for November 2012, almost all of the available U.S. Debt availability would be consumed. Note: In an article The Wall Street December 12, it was that U.S. currently has only about $67 billion remaining in borrowing capacity. The red line represents total borrowing capacity of the United States that is above the current aggregate outstanding U.S. Debt. 2012, U.S. borrowing increased such that the remaining availability has , leaving the availability in November 2012 at just $172 billion.

The pipe insulation roller coaster project is one of the most enjoyable projects I've ever used in class. It was my second year teaching physics. During the unit on energy, the book we were using frequently used roller coasters in their We even had a little \"roller use with photo gates. I thought we could do better. My original idea was to get some flexible Hot Wheels and some loop-de-loops and hills. Turns out a class of Hot Wheels track pretty expensive. On an unrelated yet serendipitous to my local big box hardware store, I ran across the perfect cheap!) substitute: Pipe Insulation!. For $1.30 or so you can get six of pipe insulation- which doubles nicely as a track1 when you split the pipe insulation into two equal halves. It's really easy to cut pipe insulation with a pair of scissors. Just be sure you don't buy the \"self-sealing\" pipe has glue pre-applied- it's expensive and it'd into a sticky mess. At first I planning simply design a one-period using the pipe insulation (my original ideas into the pre-activity for this project). As I started think through the project more and I realized could go way bigger. thus, the pipe insulation roller coaster project born. Building the Coasters groups of students were 24 feet of pipe insulation (4 pieces), roll of tape2, and access to a large of cardboard All groups had to to a few standard requirements: - Construction requirements The entire roller coaster must fit within a 1.0m x 2.0m rectangle4. - There must be at least two inversions (loops, corkscrews, etc.). - All 24 feet of pipe insulation must be used. - The track must 50 above the ground. addition to meeting the above were required to utilize their understanding of the work-energy theorem, circular motion, and friction to the - Determine average rolling friction, kinetic energy, and energy at 8 locations on their roller coaster. - the minimum velocities required for the marble to stay on the at the top of all the inversions - Determine the g-forces the marble experiences through the inversions at least five corners, hills, or valleys. - The g-forces must be kept \"safe\" levels5. - Rolling friction, kinetic and potential energy - The energy () is easy enough to find after measuring the height of the track and finding the mass of the marble. The kinetic energy trickier and be done by filming the marble and doing some analysis with Tracker, but since the speed the marble is likely to be a little too fast for most to pick up clearly, probably (and much faster) to simply measure the time it takes the marble travel a certain length of track. I describe this can be done a previous post, so check out for more info. That post also includes how to calculated the coefficient of friction by finding much work was done on the marble to friction- so I'll keep things shorter here by not re-explaining that process. - Have mark every 10 cm or so on their track before they start putting together (note the tape marks in this pic). Since in in case is the length of track the marble has so far, it finding the value for d easier than trying to measure a twisting, roller coaster track. - This is also called the critical velocity. That's fitting. If you're riding a roller coaster pretty critical that you make it around each loop. Also, you might be in critical condition if you don't. While falling to our death would exciting, it limits the to ride coasters in future (and I like roller coasters). Since we're primarily concerned with what is happening to the marble at the of here's a diagram of the vertical forces on the marble at the very top of the loop: So just normal force (the track pushing on the marble) and gravitational force earth on the marble). Since these forces are both acting the center the they're equal to the radial force: When the marble is just making it around loop critical velocity), the normal goes to That is, the stops pushing on the marble for just an instant at the of the loop. If the normal force stays for any longer than that it means marble in free fall, and that's just not safe. So: when you substitute in and accelerations for the and do rearranging: There you go. All need to know is the radius of the loop, and that's easy enough to measure. Of course, want a little cushion the critical velocity, especially because we're ignoring the friction that is constantly slowing d",

Perry Perry, M.D., Ph.D., MPH, is a senior in the Department of International Health at Johns University’s Bloomberg of Public Health in Baltimore, Md. During past half-century, there has been a recognition that community-based workers can an important contribution to the health of communities, especially in resource-constrained settings. These workers are known by many names, but most Community Workers (CHWs). initial training of usually weeks or less, they can effectively provide different types of services from community mobilization to health education to preventive screening to family planning education to identifying persons symptoms of leprosy or tuberculosis to diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening childhood illness, and many more. These persons may work as volunteers or for modest or salaries. Based on early projects that CHWs effectively in a number of developing countries, seminal International Conference on Primary Health Care — sponsored by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 1978 and attended by high-level representatives of almost every country in the world — recognized that in many where facilities highly trained workers are CHWs can an important part of a primary health care system. The Declaration of Alma Ata, adopted at the conference, called for basic health services — promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative to be “health workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and community [italics added] as applicable, as well as traditional as needed, suitably trained socially and technically to as a health team and to to the expressed needs of the community.” The Declaration also recognized the importance of health services “as as possible where live and work.” A rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate that make it to access and improve coverage of essential services, particularly in remote poorly served populations, thereby improving equity. have been shown to play critical roles in interventions to - reduce child mortality, including distribution vitamin A capsules and other critical micronutrients - promote and sanitation education (hand point-of-use water treatment and safe water storage, latrine construction and promotion of latrine use) - distribute mosquito and assist communities in draining stagnant to breeding grounds for mosquitoes - diagnose and treat childhood pneumonia, diarrhea, newborn sepsis and severe malnutrition - promote healthy behaviors such as appropriate breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding until at least one year of age) - provide hygiene and cleanliness education - ensure appropriate care of newborns - promote and facilitate immunizations for mothers and Many countries can benefit by scaling up integrated management pneumonia, diarrhea, and newborn sepsis and promotion of healthy behaviors that can save the lives of millions of children who are dying from preventable causes. CHWs are one of the essential ingredients for making this possible — along with commitment, leadership, long-term training, and supervision the health system logistical support of basic medicines and supplies. A commitment by the world community to these activities, which are some of most cost-effective approaches to promoting global in health, is moral imperative for today tomorrow. James the renowned director of from 1980 1995 and champion what is often referred to as the First Child Survival Revolution, repeatedly reminded us “morality must march with capacity.” We know that CHWs can have the capacity to make a difference between life death for millions of children. The moral imperative for the world is to ensure that health systems and underserved communities support CHWs in attaining capacity. Berman, P. A., D. R.

According to the books, the Garo tribe entered Bangladesh in the first century. They were from Mongolia and came to this region through Tibet. The Garo have stayed in for thousands of years. Initially, they followed a religion Sonatoni; during the British rule in this subcontinent came to Christ. nearly 100 percent of the Garo tribe Christianity, though a few in Sonatoni. Garos have their own language, which is completely from the language, Bengali. Achik has several accents/branches such Habeng, Attong, etc. The Garo tribe also has own culture. Their food habits and celebration styles can easily distinguished from the Bengalis and other tribes. The people from the Garo tribe have different features than the original inhabitants of (Bengali people). They are a little shorter and have fair skin. Their eyes and nose are to their ancestors from Mongolia. Compared to other tribal groups, the Garo tribe is little advanced education and social activities. The first Garo church (Garo Baptist Convention) was established in 1910. Many missionaries and evangelists from Europe and North worked among the Garo people over the decades. Being of a developing country, the community suffers from Many Garo families are deprived of education. Garos in villages and in remote places suffer from lack of clean water and sanitation. There are many villages like Gobindopur and Nalchapra, which greatly need hospitals medical facilities. The people Garo community have go to the local pharmacy for minor diseases or injuries. major problems, they have to take the patient to the town, is about 35 kilometers away. The Garo have only high school (sixth 10th grade) with a of only children. This government school only nine teachers. two primary schools in those villages with limited capacity and facilities. The houses of the Garo people are of bamboo walls and straw or tin roofs. houses have mud walls a roof of straw and plastic sheets. House are typically 7 feet wide and 14 feet long. The Garo build their own houses. they have free spaces in front their houses. cows, chicken and ducks as pets. Garo usually have an average of two to three children. Thirty of the Garo people have completed high school. However, the remaining 70 percent have not; poor families can’t afford to send their children to school. The government Bangladesh has ensured all children can attend primary school. But many children from Garo community drop out after the primary level. The educated people from the Garo community work in nongovernmental and other corporate organizations. The poorer people earn their keep by working as day laborers, usually in the crop fields for nine or 10 hours daily. Available transportation in Garo villages is cycle or for long distances. But since most peope can’t afford the fare, they walk. Cycle-vans are used carry goods. In the both male and have to work for the family. The interesting part is that the Garo ladies get ownership of the properties the family, a tradition completely opposite of the Bengali people. The festivals are very colorful and full of music and dancing. and Easter are two major religious festivals.

This large multivolume resource various congressional reports and documents from the beginning of the federal government, and its coverage is wide and varied. Women, African Americans, Native Americans, soldiers and sailors, pensioners, landowners, and inventors are represented in some fashion. While a beginning genealogist would not use the Serial Set to begin a family history, it nevertheless can serve as valuable tool and resource for someone helping to flesh out an ancestors life, especially where coincided with the interests of the U.S. federal government. Since its inception, the U.S. government has gathered information, held hearings, compiled reports, and published those findings literally millions of pages, the majority of been published the Government Printing Office (GPO). These publications include annual reports of the executive branch agencies, congressional hearings and documents, of employees, and telephone directories. Their topics cover a wide range, the Ku Klux Klan to child labor practices to immigration to western exploration. In 1817, the Serial Set was begun with the intent of being the official, collective, definitive documenting the activities of the federal Following the destruction of the Capitol in 1814 by the British, Congress became interested in publishing their records to make them more accessible and less vulnerable to loss. In the early Federal period, printing of congressional had been haphazard, and the Serial Set was an effort designed to rectify that situation. Although initially there were no regulations concerning what should be included, several laws and regulations were promulgated over the years. The contents, therefore, vary depending on the year in question. In 1831, 14 after the Serial Set was begun, printers Gales Seaton proposed that a compilation the documents from the first Congresses be printed. The secretary of the Senate and clerk of the House were to direct the of those documents, 6,278 of were published in 38 between 1832 and 1861. This collection was known as the American State Papers. Because it was retrospective effort, these 38 volumes were chronologically within 10 subject areas: Foreign Relations, Indian Affairs, Finance, Commerce & Navigation, Military Affairs, Naval Affairs, Post Office, Public Lands, Claims, and Miscellaneous. Although not technically a part of the Serial Set, the volumes were related, and therefore the volumes were designated a leading zero so volumes be shelved properly, before volumes of the Serial Set. (1) The Congressional Serial Set itself includes six distinct series: House and Senate journals (until 1953), House and Senate reports, House and Senate documents, Senate treaty documents, Senate executive reports, and miscellaneous reports. The journals provide information about the daily of each chamber. The House and reports relate to public and private legislation consideration during each session. Documents generally relate to other investigations or subjects that have come to the attention of Congress. Nominations for office and promotion appear in the Senate Reports. reports are just thatwidely varied in subject matter and content.

Consistently getting a night’s sleep may help protect children from becoming overweight adults, a study published Monday suggests. Researchers found that more than 1,000 people followed from birth to age 32, those who got too little as children were more likely than their well-rested counterparts to become adults, Reuters News reports. The link between deprivation during childhood and obesity later in life held up even when the researchers figured in things the impact of a child’s or TV habits, and adulthood exercise level. All of this supports the idea that sleep habits have direct effect on weight in the long term, according to Dr. Robert John Hancox, the study’s senior author. “Although we cannot prove that this is a cause-and-effect relationship,” he Reuters Health, “this study strong evidence it is.” Eating more fish can help you control diabetes.

The Combined Gas Law states that a gas pressure x volume x temperature = constant. Alright. class you should have learned about three different gas laws. the first one being Boyle's law and it talks about the relationship between pressure and volume of particular next one should be Charles law which talks about the and temperature of particular gas. And the last one should be Gay Lussac's which talks about the relationship between pressure and temperature of a particular gas. Okay. But happens when you pressure, volume and all changing? Well, we're actually to these gas laws to form giant gas law called combined gas law. Okay. If you notice then these three gas laws the pressure volume are always in the numerator. So we're going to them on the numerator. p1v1. And notice the temperature is in the denominator t1. So all these things are just squished into one and then p2v2 over t2. Okay. So this is what we're going to call the combined gas law. So let's actually get an example and do one together. Alright, so I have a problem up here that says gas at 110 kilo pascals and 33 celsius fills a flexible container with initial of litres, okay? If the temperature raised 80 degrees celsius and the pressure is raised to 440 kilo pascals, what is the new volume? Okay. So notice we have three variables. We're talking about pressure, temperature and volume. Okay, so now we're going to employ combined gas law with all of these variables. So we're going look at our first, our first number 110 kilo pascals and that's going to, that is the unit of pressure. So we know that's p1 is kilo pascals, at 30 celsius. don't like things with celsius so I'm going to change this to So I'm going to add 273 to that which makes it 303 kelvin. That's our temperature. And my initial volume is two litres so I'm going say v1=2 Okay then I continue reading. If the is raised 80 degree celsius, again we want it in kelvin, so we're going to add 273 making it to 353. So our t2 is 353 kelvin and pressure increased to kilo pascals, the pressure p2 is equal to 440 pascals which I'm very happy that I kept it in kilo pascals that I kept it in kilo pascals. I've to make sure these units are the same pressure can be measured in several different units. I'm to make sure all units are the same. And what is the new So our v2 is our variable, what we're trying to find. let's basically plug all these variable in our combined gas law to figure what the volume would be. Okay. So I'm going to erase and say our pressure one is kilo pascals. Our volume one is two litres. Our one is 303 kelvin. Our pressure two is 440 kilo pascals. We don't know our so we're just going to say over 353 kelvin. Okay. I'm looking for a variable I'm going to cross multiply these guys. So I'm going to say 353 times 110 times 2 and that should give me seven, 77660, if you put in a calculator. I cross multiply these guys. And I cross these 303 times 440 times v2 gives me 133320v2. so then I want to get my, I to isolate my variable, so I'm going to divide 133320. 133320. And I find that my volume is 0.58. 0.58 metres.

The spread of the disease was traced back to a small military that built years before, its faulty sanitation system that allowed fecal matter to pollute nearby river.

The venerable British texts merit an obligatory nod of tribute to that paradoxical cradle of constitutional state. A few European constitutional are the cumulative result of successive of texts originally drafted in the nineteenth century or earlier, and are found those that managed avoid the dramatic upheavals which punctuate the histories of other European states. The majority of the constitutions were after the Second World War, following governmental ruptures of varying intensity and duration. A final group of texts have their origin the inter-war period and were drafted to creation, or re-creation, of their corresponding \"reformed\" texts often contain some structural traces of their origins in the preservation of the monarchy, or in the use traditional formulae. However, the depth of the changes that were out makes it impossible to establish clear distinctions, based upon constitutional content, between these and newer texts. Even those differences arising from the opposition of monarchy and republic are difficult to delineate clearly, in part due to the anomaly presented by Spain. The Spanish constitution is a constitution, but is also monarchical. In addition, the opposition in to the constitutional order no longer of political importance. The King of is reputed have stated before his coronation that \"my aspiration is to be king of Spanish Republic\" - a sentiment that acknowledged the reality that European monarchies are nothing more than republics with crowns.

Or, put another way, if I told you there a way create 10 outstanding networks of schools for students who lack decent educational now but that the cost doing this would be the of four lousy networks of schools, would you take deal? Critics of charter schools say this choice a one and that should instead focus on improving existing schools. But their argument ignores the immediacy of educational failure. We’re talking about communities where public not failing just a little but where the catastrophe broken lives unfolds every school year, places where less than half of high schoolers graduate and where fewer than one ten students finish college by their mid-20s. And not forget, despite all the about turning around persistently schools, that successful turnarounds like snow leopards — more than actually proponents also disagree with the lose-some-to-win-some premise. Their main argument against it is that bad can be shut down. It’s true that this does — government officials have refused renew some charters — but it’s proving be more difficult in practice in theory. an old saw in education that closing a school is like moving a cemetery: you get very little help from the inside. parents and teachers often resist school closures just like their in the traditional system, and today there are not enough effective — strong — charter school authorizers around the country.And I agree with that completely. If we to achieve great success, the only way to figure out what works better is to try new and some of those approaches will not succeed--may even be worse than already But difference is choice that parents have. Leaving just the monopoly system real variety and choice for parents shackles students to a school a system that has been mediocre or for decades. When there are no shackles, and parents can freely to greener pastures. However, Utah also faces the same conundrum the noted above, namely that parents and school officials often the closure of charter just like same groups do at traditional schools. That makes it politically difficult to pull the closing trigger, and it's never actually happened in Utah. a free-market guy who generally believes that if parents are satisfied enough to stay a a school, even if the bureaucracy or the government doesn't like it, we should give deference to are choosing the best option for their kid, even if the system thinks they Finding the balance between parental choice and public accountability is a balance. So, suggest that Utah needs the following: - Expansion of charter schools, particularly successful charter schools, so that parents' choices are not limited by mile-long lists; - School districts that embrace innovation, relying less on boundaries, and that really empower schools to innovate and achieve--along with risks that come with allowing parents to choose to leave; - A realistic mechanism to close or replace failing schools, both traditional and including making it easier to convert a traditional school to a charter (the Charter Board has made progress in this area, but I believe they also need an enrollment trigger); - Real freedom in to allow for the variety that gives families real choices, including freedom in whom they hire, what teach (let a school decide that more time teaching reading more important than teaching how to use laundry how they fear to try something and fail.",

It focuses on sustainability and of the environment, and is rooted in fair economic practices and When you purchase an item labeled as trade, you are helping support fair prices, environmental protections, direct trade, fair labor conditions, and local communities. Why Buy Fair Trade Our modern world economy puts a heavy focus on the bottom line: in decision between two similar products, price is usually the deciding However, this practice often discriminates against small craftsmen, and labor cooperatives, since their per-unit production and materials costs are higher than those of mass producers. Additionally, major manufacturers may employ unjust business practices, such as low wages or poor worker rights, to maintain low prices for their finished products. Fair trade, on the other hand, honors the developing world's small businesses and promotes rights for workers and producers around the Additionally, this business model social development, helping fund schools and community growth, and directly some of the world's poorest communities. & Fair Labor The international Fair Trade Labeling Organization sets the price for all Fair Trade products, ensuring that item is priced justly. By these standards, a fair price adequately covers the cost the production and living wages workers. A wage is defined as sufficient to cover medical care, education, shelter cost of living. Fair trade companies, farmers and artisans respect their environment and engage sustainable production. For example, fair trade farmers avoid the use of most agrochemicals by employing natural methods like crop rotation and biological pest control. 85% of Fair Trade Certified™ coffee is organically. The conventional supply employs many intermediaries – buyers, exporters, and importers, among others. Fair supports a more route, connecting a producer or cooperative to a fair trade distributor, then to the store. This process allows for profit dilution, fosters long-term relationships between producers importers.

If you’re collecting day or after a heavy rain, you need your mud boots on. Mississippi is its gooey clay.” The society regular trips to hunt for new rocks and minerals. In these litigious days, it’s important to get permission from owners before the searching begins. Provisions include a rock hammer, shovel and glasses, as well as containers to hold fresh finds and a screwdriver to pry things up, Roberts said. “You’ve got to pack your own lunch and water,” she said. “Some of the places we collect at are old quarries, so there any facilities. You have to be pretty self- sufficient.” Society members have loaned some of their finds for an exhibit at Oren Dunn City Museum in Tupelo’s Park.

Does that have anything to do with the substance of the ideas? So there's really no general agreement on what constructivism is. Some people argue it's not curriculum or pedagogy, it's brain science. I use it to refer to those approaches of mathematics that require students to develop their mathematics scratch. It might include \"Problem Solving,\" Learning,\" and \"Inquiry-based Learning (IBL).\" My apologies to those who claim that I do violence to their pet definitions here. But there do seem be two general camps. On the one we have those who think students should learn efficient, time-tested methods solving problems, and learn them mastery (automation).

These I call \"constructivists.\" The answer is actually simple. We need both. However, sacrifices must made, there one approach that is essential, and one that is merely desirable. Unfortunately, reasonable people disagree about which is This, however, is my blog, so opinion is right. The much-maligned traditional is essential. We must first realize that there is a great deal of disinformation floating around about the traditional method. Its opponents claim the traditional method teaches rote memorization without understanding or thinking. Except perhaps in some isolated enclaves where stereotypically poor teaching took place, this has never the All the widely used math textbooks of 19th century, for example, emphasized \"mental arithmetic,\" that is, the ability to think through multiple-step problems \"in your head\" and give the solution, not only without a calculator but even without a pencil. The kinds of thinking and understanding that were required differed from what expected today, because the skill set an educated person has changed. So in those days, being able to sums in your head was far more important than, say, sketching the graph an exponential function. In honest we must realize that \"Back-to-the-Basics\" or \"traditional education\" does not imply restricting ourselves to the content or of a bygone era. The primary features of the traditional method include: 1) Understanding a mathematical concept, e.g. \"What does it mean to add two numbers?\" 2) Memorization of basic facts/definitions/results, e.g. \"the Times Tables.\" 3)Application of knowledge to novel problems and more advanced concepts. 4) Review and maintenance knowledge.

The memory can access permanent memory for information it needs.

A 2007 study published in Science, for example, showed that only 10 percent of children experience high-quality instruction throughout their elementary years. So we applaud the focus effective teaching in principle. What we wish is that it would much deeper.

Politics aside, however, the new policy will certainly make waves in early learning schools and social services agencies, where children and young parents affected by the new policy are likely to interact schools government programs in new ways. Under the new policy, undocumented residents under 30 will be allowed to reside in the United if they meet a of criteria, such as having arrived in the United States before the age of 16 or having either high school diploma, GED or in the The policy does not provide a path to citizenship, like many Democrat versions the DREAM Act have in the past. three of our biggest questions on what’s to come: 1) parents with children in states with strict immigration laws actually feel more protected? Will those states bend to meet the spirit of the federal policy? The administration is that it wants to focus resources on deporting people that pose “national security or public safety risk,” and less on deporting as illegal immigrants as possible, of their contributions to society. But the new policy, which the Associated Press estimates will affect up to 800,000 young people, doesn’t necessarily change the mood in states such as Alabama, where a law passed last year (and currently being challenged by the Obama administration in the 11th circuit U.S. Court of Appeals) requires children to document their status when they enroll in school. Many believe the law is families with more than one undocumented member, and preventing them from sending their children to school — despite the fact that undocumented children have the right to a public education in the U.S. 2) Will the new policy have any effect on families’ enrollment in home visiting programs or on children’s enrollment in child care and pre-K programs? Parents who reside in United States illegally have been known anecdotally to shy away from enrolling in home visiting programs and/or pre-K for fear that officials find out the immigration status of the family. It’s possible, young immigrant parents in standing with the will be more inclined to enroll in such programs in the future. 3) How parents with young children, illegal or legal, will be Many under 30 are now to stay the United States, but there is a limit to how helpful this will be: For example, under the new policy, an undocumented old with over 30 risks losing his or her parents due to that immigrant children grow up without their parents being deported isn’t the goal of the new policy. It’s something to keep in mind, however, as these policies evolve and change in the future. If providing children with solid education life opportunities and focusing immigration on those who pose security and public risks the ultimate goal, then policies that help families while kids are growing up is a next step, though it’s we’ll see much further on this front until takes up the long-overdue issue immigration reform.

With all these starts and stops over and decades, you may think: the point of trying? Or maybe you’ve given up to just poor health as part life. the inability to “stick with it” has many facets, some of which you may not be able to control. fact, shows that the self-control needed to succeed in many of these may be a limited resource. In 2006, Michael Inzlicht and colleagues at the of Scarborough what happens the brain when humans try to abstain from something they want. That is, when we try to use willpower to refrain from on our urges to something specific. Failure to control one’s behavior is found in all aspects of life. It includes acting out, saying mean things, stealing and drug abuse. It also encompasses not doing things that are for you like walking, eating healthy and getting plenty of rest. Inzlicht set up a study, published journal Psychological Science, tested participants’ self-control time. Participants were first asked to do something to deplete their “store” willpower or behavioral control and then see how much they had left for another, unrelated task. participants an emotionally upsetting movie and were asked to suppress their emotions and try to cry during especially difficult scenes. Following this, participants completed what is called a Stroop Stroop is a psychological test that measures the reaction time needed to name colors are printed in a color not associated with the color word. In other words, saying “green” when the word “green” was in color red. This task may seem simple. While this seems simple, if you try it you will see how much self-control it takes not to blurt out the printed color and to have to that urge and replace it with a correct response. During both the watching of the and the Stroop task, participants’ brain activity was measured by an (electroencephalography) device. This records the electrical activity the scalp to measure changes the brain’s neurons. What the researchers discovered was intriguing. When participants had to themselves and exert quite a bit of self-control not expressing emotions or when trying to the names of colors), an increase of brain activity in part of the brain’s lobe known as the anterior cingulate cortex. This is the region of the brain involved in autonomic functions, like regulating blood pressure heart rate, as well as rational cognitive functions, such anticipation, decision-making and emotion. The interesting finding in this study is that there less frontal lobe the Stroop task watching the gut-wrenching film. other words, when a amount used on one task, the next time it was needed there was less available for These suggest that people may not have as much or control over their behavior as time progresses and demands are on them to such control. It is pretty discouraging to think that the human brain is capable of providing a strong degree during a given time period. That might seem to leave most of with little hope change. Think it: If we use self-control to not eat a sticky with breakfast and force ourselves to take that morning then we will have less available control over our behavior when it comes to making lunch and dinner choices, or passing on the second round of drinks, or going to the gym or yoga class. Is it any wonder why so many fail diets and exercise routines and time again? Well, this needn’t be the case more information has recently been published issue. A study headed by Inzlicht, this time with colleague Brandon Schmeichel of Texas A&M University, appeared in the September issue of the journal Perspectives Psychological In this further research, Inzlicht now finds that the “limited resource” of self-control is too narrow and does not explain the exceptions, the times when self-control is in place and one is able to maintain the level necessary effect positive change by making good choices.

Read the book review!| article was written and annotated by members of the Microsoft Common Runtime (CLR) and .NET teams and other experts.) Type Design Guidelines in .NET From the CLR perspective, there are two categories of types—reference types and value types—but for the purpose of framework design discussion we divide types into more logical groups, each with its own specific design 4-1 these logical groups. Classes are the general case of reference types. They make up the bulk types in the majority of frameworks. Classes owe popularity to the rich set object-oriented features they support and to their applicability. classes and abstract classes are special logical groups related to extensibility. Extensibility and base classes are covered in Chapter 6. Interfaces are types that can be implemented both by reference types and types. This allows them to serve as roots of polymorphic hierarchies of reference types and value types. In addition, interfaces can be to simulate multiple inheritance, which is not natively supported by the CLR. Structs are the general of value types and should be reserved for small, simple types, similar to language Enums are a special case of value used to define short sets of values, such as days of the week, console colors, and so on. Static classes are types intended as containers for static members. They are commonly used to shortcuts to other operations. Delegates, exceptions, attributes, arrays, and collections are all special cases of reference types intended for specific uses, guidelines for their design and usage are discussed elsewhere in this book. - DO ensure that each type is a well-defined set of related members, not just a random collection of unrelated functionality. - It is that a type can be described in one simple A good definition should also rule out functionality that is only tangentially you have ever managed a team of people you know that they don't do well without a crisp set of responsibilities. Well, types work the same way. I have noticed that types without a firm and focused scope tend to be magnets for more random functionality, which, over time, make a small problem a worse. It becomes more difficult to justify why the next member with even more random functionality does not belong in the type. As the focus the members in a type blurs, the developer's ability to predict where to find a given functionality is impaired, and therefore so productivity.| |Good types are like good diagrams: What has been omitted is as important to clarity and usability as what has been included. Every additional member you add to a type starts at a net negative value and only by proven usefulness does it go from there to positive. If you add too much in attempt to make the type more useful to some, you are just as likely to type useless to everyone.| | When I was learning OOP in the early 1980s, I was taught a mantra that I honor today: If things too complicated, make more types. Sometimes, I find that I am thinking really hard trying to define good set of methods for a type. When I start to feel that I'm spending too much on this or when just don't seem to fit together well, I remember my mantra I define more, smaller types where each type has well-defined functionality. This has worked extremely well for me over the years. On the flip side, sometimes types do end up being dumping grounds for various loosely related functions.

Advantages over SQL Unlike SQL, XQuery just tables but arbitrary tree structures. This allows XQuery to directly create XHTML structures that can used in web pages. XQuery is for XML-based object databases, and object databases are much more and powerful than databases which store in tabular format. XSLT, XQuery can be learned by anyone familiar with SQL. of the constructs are very similar such as: - Ordering Results: Both XQuery and SQL add an order byclause to the query. - Selecting Distinct Values: XQuery and SQL have easy ways to select distinct values from a result set - Restricting Rows: Both XQuery and SQL have a X=Y clause can be added an XQuery Another big is that XQuery is essentially the native query of the World Wide Web.

XSLT has many patterns that unfamiliar to many procedural software developers. Also, whereas XSLT is good for using as a static to convert one type of document to another, for example RSS to HTML, XQuery is more dynamic querying tool, useful for pulling out sections of from large and/or large number of documents. Debate about XQuery vs. for Transformation There been a sorts about the merits of the two languages for transforming XML: XSLT and XQuery. A common misconception is that \"XQuery is best for querying XML, and XSLT best for it.\" In reality, both methods are capable of transforming XML. Despite XSLT's longer history and larger install base, the \"XQuery typeswitch\" of transforming XML provides numerous advantages. Most people need to transform XML hear that they need to learn a called XSLT. XSLT, whose first version was published by the W3C in 1999, was a huge innovation for its indeed, remains dominant. It was one of the very first languages dedicated to transforming XML documents, and it was the first language (DSL) to use theories from the world of functional to create reliable, side-effect transformations. Many XML developers still feel strong indebted to this groundbreaking language, since it helped them see a new model development: one focused around the transformation of models and empowering them to fuse both the and documentation of a transformation routing into a single, modular On the hand, learning XSLT requires overcoming a very substantial learning curve. XSLT's difficulty due, in part, to one of the key design decisions by its architects: to express the transformation using XML itself, than a brand new syntax grammar for the transformation rules. XSLT's unique approach to transformation rules also contributes the steepness of the learning curve. The learning curve can be overcome, but it is fair to say learning curve has created a opening for an approach. XQuery has filled this demand for an alternative among a growing community of users: they find XQuery a lower learning curve, meets their needs for transforming XML, together with XQuery's other advantages, it has become a compelling \"all-in-one\" language. Like XSLT, XQuery was created by the W3C to handle XML. But instead of expressing the language in XML syntax, the architects of XQuery chose a new that would be more familiar users of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, or Python. XQuery was designed to be similar to users of relational database query languages such as SQL, while remaining true to functional programming practices. Despite its relative youth (XQuery 1.0 was only released 2007 when XSLT had already reached its version 2.0), XQuery was born remarkably mature. XML servers like eXist-db and MarkLogic were already using XQuery as their language for querying XML and performing operations (obviating the need for learning PHP, Perl, or Python). So,",

It is a set of points in an n-dimensional space, often represented as an ellipsoid around a which is an estimated solution to a problem, although other shapes can occur. The confidence region is calculated in such a way that a of measurements were repeated many and a confidence region calculated in the same way on set of measurements, then a certain percentage of the time, on average, (e.g. 95%) the confidence region would include the point representing the \"true\" values of of being estimated.

The Gupta script was from Brahmi and gave rise to the Nagari, Sharada and Siddham scripts. These scripts in turn gave to many of the most important scripts of India, Devanagari (the most common script used for writing Sanskrit since the 19th century), the Gurmukhi script for Punjabi Language and the Tibetan script. Origins and Classification The Script was descended from the Ashokan Brahmi script, and is a crucial link between Brahmi and most other scripts in the Brahmic family of Scripts, a family of alphasyllabaries or abugidas. This that while only phonemes have distinct symbols, marked by diacritics, with being the pronunciation when the diacritic is not present. In fact, the Gupta script works in exactly the same manner as predecessor and successors, and only the forms of the graphemes and diacritics are different. Through the 4th century, letters began to take more cursive and symmetric forms, a result of the desire to write more quickly and aesthetically. This meant the script became more differentiated throughout the Empire, with regional variations which have been broadly classified into three, four or five categories; however, a classification is not clear, even on a single inscription, there may be variation in how a particular symbol is written. In this sense, the term Gupta script should be taken to mean form of writing derived from the Gupta period, even though may be a lack of uniformity in the scripts. The surviving inscriptions of the Gupta script are mostly found on or stone pillars, and on gold from the Gupta One of the most the Prasasti. Composed by Harishena, the court poet and minister of Samudragupta, it describes Samudragupta’s reign, beginning from his ascension to throne as the second king of the Gupta Dynasty and including his other kings.

Many of the Gupta Empire’s coins bear inscriptions of legends mark historic events. In fact, it was one the first Indian Empires to do so, probably as a result unprecedented prosperity. Almost every Gupta king issued coins, beginning with its first king, Chandragupta I.

It was so-named after V of France, who resumed the war after the Treaty of Brétigny (signed 1360). In May the Black Prince, son of Edward III of England, refused an illegal summons from the French king he come to Paris and responded declaring war. He immediately set out reverse territorial losses imposed Brétigny and he was largely successful in his lifetime. His Charles VI, made with of the Black Prince, II, in 1389. This truce was extended many times until the war was resumed in 1415. The reign of Charles V saw the English steadily pushed back. Although the English-backed claimant to the Duchy of Brittany, John of Montfort, defeated and killed the French Charles of Blois, at the Battle of Auray in 1364, John and heirs eventually with kings. The War of the Breton Succession ended in of English, but gave them no great advantage. In the French received the benefit of improved generalship in the of the Breton commander Bertrand du Guesclin, who, leaving Brittany, entered the service of Charles and became one of his most successful generals. At about the time, a war in Spain occupied the Black Prince's efforts from 1366. The Castilian Civil War pitted Pedro the Cruel, whose daughters Constance and Isabella were married the Black Prince's brothers John Gaunt and Edmund of Langley, against Henry of Trastámara. In with the support of Du Guesclin, Henry deposed Pedro to Henry II of Castile. He then went to war with England, which was with Portugal. years Just before New Year's Day 1370, the English seneschal of Poitou, John Chandos, was killed at the bridge at Lussac-les-Châteaux. The loss of this commander was significant blow to the English. Jean III de Grailly, the captal de Buch, was also captured and locked up by Charles, did not bound by \"outdated\" chivalry. Du Guesclin a series of careful campaigns, avoiding major English field forces, but capturing town after town, including Poitiers in 1372 and Bergerac in 1377. Du Guesclin, who according to Jean Froissart, had advised French king to the English in the field, was successful in these Fabian tactics, though in the only two major battles in which fought, Auray (1364) and Nájera (1367), he was on the losing side and was captured but released for ransom. The English response to Du Guesclin was launch series of destructive military called chevauchées, in an effort at total war to destroy the countryside and the productivity of the land. But Du Guesclin refused to be drawn open battle. He continued his command of the French armies until his death in In 1372, English dominance at which had been upheld since the Battle of Sluys, was reversed, at least in the Bay Biscay, by the disastrous defeat by a joint Franco-Castilian fleet at the Battle of La Rochelle. This defeat undermined English seaborne trade supplies and threatened their Gascon possessions. In 1376, the Black Prince died, and in 1377, III England sent his Adam Houghton, to negotiate for peace with Charles, but in June Edward himself died, Houghton was called home.

A real Lie algebra g0 is called a real form of a complex Lie algebra g if g is complexification g0: Real forms for Lie groups and algebraic groups Using Lie correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, the notion a real form can be defined for Lie groups. In the case of linear algebraic groups, the notions of complexification and real form have a natural description in the language of algebraic geometry. Just as complex semisimple Lie algebras are by Dynkin diagrams, the real forms of a semisimple Lie are classified Satake diagrams, are obtained the Dynkin diagram of the complex form by labeling vertices (filled), and some vertices in pairs by arrows, to certain rules. It is a fact in the structure theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras that every such algebra has two special real forms: one is the compact real form corresponds a compact Lie group under the Lie correspondence (its Satake diagram has all vertices blackened), other is the real form corresponds to a Lie group that is as far as possible from being compact (its Satake diagram has no vertices and no arrows). In case of the complex special linear group SL(n,C), the compact is the special unitary group SU(n) and the split real form the real special linear group SL(n,R). The classification of real forms of semisimple Lie algebras was accomplished by Cartan in the of Riemannian spaces. In general, there be more than real forms. Suppose that g0 a semisimple Lie over the field of real numbers. By Cartan's criterion, the Killing form is nondegenerate, and can be diagonalized in suitable basis with entries +1 or -1. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the number entries, or the positive index of intertia, is invariant of the bilinear form, it does not on the of the basis. This a number between 0 and dimension of g which is important invariant of the Lie algebra, called its index. Split real form A real form a complex Lie algebra g is said to be split, or normal, if in each Cartan decomposition g0 = k0 ⊕ p0, the space p0 contains a maximal Abelian subalgebra of i.e. its Cartan subalgebra. Élie Cartan proved that every complex semisimple Lie algebra g has a split real form, is unique to isomorphism. It maximal index among all real forms. The split form corresponds to the diagram with no vertices blackened and no arrows. real form A real Lie algebra g0 is compact if the Killing form negative definite, i.e. the index of g0 is zero. In this case g0 = k0 is a compact Lie algebra. is known that under the Lie correspondence, compact Lie algebras correspond to compact Lie groups. The compact form to the Satake diagram with all vertices blackened. Construction the compact real form In general, the construction of the compact real form uses structure theory of semisimple Lie For classical Lie algebras there is a more explicit construction. Let g0 be a real Lie algebra of matrices over R that is under the transpose map, The complexification g of decomposes into the direct sum of g0 and ig0. The real vector space of is a subspace of the complex Lie algebra g that is closed under commutators and of skew-hermitian matrices. It follows that u0 is a real Lie subalgebra of g, that its Killing is negative definite (making it a compact Lie algebra), and that the complexification of u0 is g. Therefore, is a compact form of g.

The discovery gives hope to the most big cat, calls to some of the world's tallest mountains. Between 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards remain the wild scattered across a dozen countries in Central Asia. study, which appears in the June 29th issue of the of Environmental Studies, is by WCS conservationists Anthony Simms, Zalmai Moheb, Salahudin, Hussain Ali, Inayat Ali and Timothy Wood. WCS-trained community rangers used camera traps to document the presence of snow at 16 different locations across a wide landscape. The images represent the first camera trap records of snow leopards in Afghanistan. has been conserving wildlife and improving local livelihoods in the since 2006 with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). \"This is a discovery – it that there is real snow leopards in Afghanistan,\" Peter WCS Deputy Director for Asia \"Now our goal is to ensure that animals have a future as a key part of natural heritage.\" According the study, snow leopards remain threatened in the region. Poaching for their pelts, persecution by shepherds, the of live animals the illegal pet trade have all been documented in the Corridor. In response, WCS has developed a set of conservation initiatives to snow leopards. These include partnering with local communities, training of rangers, and outreach efforts. Anthony Simms, lead author and the project's Technical Advisor, said, \"By developing a community-led management approach, we believe leopards will be conserved in Afghanistan over the long term.\" WCS-led initiatives are already paying off. Conservation education is now occurring in every school the Wakhan region. Fifty-nine rangers have been trained to date. They monitor not only snow leopards but species including Marco Polo sheep ibex while also enforcing laws against WCS has also initiated the construction of predator-proof livestock corrals and a livestock insurance program that compensates shepherds, though initial research shows that surprisingly few livestock fall to predators in the region.

This long-term strategy aims to help Europe become a recycling society that seeks to avoid waste and uses waste as a resource. It will draw on the knowledge that the thematic strategy on resources, also adopted today, will generate. a first step, the Commission revising the Waste Directive to set recycling standards and to include an obligation for Member States to develop national waste prevention programmes. revision will merge, streamline and clarify legislation, contributing to better regulation. waste and resources strategies are two of the seven 'thematic' strategies required under the 6th Environment Action Programme (2002-2012). Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: “Waste volume has been disproportionately outpacing economic growth. Waste generation, disposal and recycling are of concern to all of us: individuals, and public authorities. Now is the to modernise our approach to promote more and recycling. Our strategy does precisely that. More waste than ever EU environment has helped improve the way we dispose waste and specific waste streams, such as municipal waste, packaging, cars and electric and electronic equipment. Waste management moved a long way from being a dirty, polluting business. High standards exist for landfills and incinerators. Industry now seeks to make a profit from waste instead of dumping it. However, waste generation in the EU is estimated at than 1.3 billion tonnes per year and is at rates comparable to economic growth. For example, both GDP and municipal waste between 1995 and 2003. consequence this growth is that despite large increases in recycling, landfill - the environmentally most problematic way to get rid of waste is only reducing slowly. Waste policy must contribute to improving the way we use resources What is needed now is to modernise and widen EU waste policy the light of new knowledge. Companies and public need to take a life-cycle approach that does not look pollution caused by waste. It must also take of how waste policies can most reduce the negative environmental impacts with the use of resources through preventing, recycling and recovering wastes. To move this objective EU waste law must create the right regulatory environment for activities to develop.

But it not just the opposition of Clemenceau and Lloyd George to some his ideas that moved the conference away from Wilson's vision. Wilson became so blindingly caught in his vision, thinking that everything he advocated democracy justice that he completely alienated the negotiators in Paris, they stopped listening to him. Another historian points to a different problem, that Wilson stopped listening to his earlier vision, become convinced that a was justified and desirable. Even if that historical view is accurate, Wilson was still more moderate in his conception of a harsh peace than were and Lloyd George. But as the conference dragged and the departure from Wilsonianism became more and more pronounced, Wilson clung to his proposal for the League of Nations. fact, he seemed to place all his faith in his pet project, believing it solve all the the negotiators were unable to solve during conference. Unfortunately, Wilson made it clear that the League was his primary objective, and came to be his only chip. He then compromised on numerous issues that had no corollary in his vision in order to maintain the for the creation of the League. Thus, though full of good intentions and a vision for a just and peaceful future, Wilson's arrogance and negotiating skills to the downfall of his vision. Finally, it must be mentioned that Wilson's inability to with the Senate in its discussion of the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles caused the to reject the Treaty, leaving the United noticeably absent the newly created League of Nations, which greatly undermined the effectiveness and importance of Wilson's principal goal. Nonetheless, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize his efforts to secure a lasting peace and success the creation of the League of Nations. David George, the British Prime Minister, entered the negotiations in with the clear support of the British people, as by convincing win in the so-called khaki election of 1918. During the weeks up to the election, though, he had publicly committed himself to work for a peace against Germany, including obtaining payments for war damages committed against the British. These campaign promises went against Lloyd George's personal Knowing that Germany had been Britain's best pre-war trading partner, he thought that Britain's best chance to return to its former prosperity was to restore Germany a financially stable situation, which would have required a fairly generous peace with respect to the vanquished enemy. Nonetheless, his campaign statements showed Lloyd understanding that public did not hold the same convictions as he did, and that, on the contrary, the public wanted extract as much as possible out of the Germans to compensate them for their losses during war. So Lloyd George and Clemenceau were in agreement on points, each seeming to the other in their nationalist objectives, and scratching each back as \"game of of Germany's power played itself out. But most historians do not attribute to Lloyd George a significant role in the Treaty negotiations. In their Clemenceau and Lloyd George were only popular sentiment home when they for terms against Germany. It is clear from accounts of the time after seeing so many young men not return from the trenches on the front, the French and British wanted to exact revenge against Germans through settlement, to that their families would never again be destroyed by German aggression. In that respect, democracy was clearly functioning as it is intended in a democracy. fact, George is the quintessential example of an elected leader serving the interests of his people, putting his personal convictions second to British public opinion. Yet it was same opinion (in France and Britain) Wilson had believed would support his internationalist agenda, placing Germany in the context of a new and peaceful world order which would prevent future aggression.

They also agree to cooperate in promoting strategic conservation priorities, such as halting biodiversity decline 2010, protecting sites, and reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. The Agreement, signed on 12 October by Mike Rands, Director and Chief Executive BirdLife International and Gilbert de Turckheim, President of was welcomed countersigned Mrs Margot Wallstr?m, Commissioner the Environment. Progress towards agreement began 2001, when the European Commission launched the Sustainable Hunting Initiative (SHI) to create a constructive between conservationists and hunters, represented by BirdLife and FACE. The SHI was started at a time when the two organisations could be considered arch-enemies, and constant confrontations on hunting issues seemed to be leading nowhere, said Dr Clairie Papazoglou, BirdLife`s Head of EU Policy. This Agreement proves that reasonable and reasonable conservationists can together for the benefit of birds and people. It represents step forward in the relations of the two organisations, which on the basis of this text can chart a list of common actions, to be carried out in the years to come. It can also be the basis on which BirdLife`s Partners can promote similar initiatives at the national level. Created: 5th Nov 2004",

Subjects were 120 Jewish volunteers comprised of equal numbers junior high-school, senior high-school, and college students of both sexes. All received three tests: A Measure for Formal Operations, The Sentence Completion Test (SCT) which measures ego development, and The Moral Judgment Interview (MJI). Results indicated the existence of significant positive correlations between the SCT and MJI in the overall sample, in the total male and female samples, in the college group, and in the female college group. No significant correlations were found the junior and senior high-school possibly due to restricted ranges of scores. In addition, most subjects at development stages 3/4 and above had attained at least conscientious-conformist level. Results also indicated the presence of differences between male and female scores. correlations for females were consistently higher than for males, scored significantly higher on the SCT, males scored significantly higher on the MJI, and the relationship between specific and ego development stages seemed to stronger for females than for males. The differences found in this between the sexes in performance on are consistent with Gilligan's theory about the distinctions between male and approaches to moral dilemmas. However, that theory was found to be inadequate in explaining the stronger relationship between MJI and SCT the females in this study. The SCT was criticized for not specifying clearly ego development features that it measured. It was suggested that exact nature of the interplay between moral and ego development could be more fully by research on specific well-defined of ego development. ^ \"COGNITIVE MORAL DEVELOPMENT AND LOEVINGER'S CONCEPT OF EGO DEVELOPMENT (KOHLBERG)\" (January 1, 1984).

It is that for which have fought and it is that ideal that has kept many a fighter going despite tremendous What is especially interesting about the history of capitalism is that with its rise there also emerged the impulse towards alternatives. These alternatives were not elaborated as eloquently were the theories behind capitalism and, specifically, democratic capitalism, but they nevertheless important. The and often criminal nature of rising capitalism brought with it revolutionary movements that challenged either the system itself or components of the system. These revolts took various forms, such as the slave revolts that spanned the entire period of the African slave Peter Linebaugh’s The Many-Headed Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic offers a glimpse into the world of the North Atlantic and the development of capitalism. It was a world of significant resistance carried out by men and women; and the free; mutinies and worker conspiracies. And most there was a deep desire, sometimes elaborated, toward a not-always-defined freedom from exploitation and oppression that accompanies With this a backdrop, one can see that the desire for a has always been a component of progressive and revolutionary anti-capitalism. Utopia was not simply a dream, but it represented the and spiritual outlines of the ideal alternative. It became something for which movements fought. For many, that utopia took the name “socialism.” In the 19th century, there were two diametrically to the question of socialism. On the one hand, there were the formations of local communities based ideal socialist principles, as and shared work. These were generally referenced as examples of “utopian socialism.” These communities attempted to live side-by-side capitalism, hoping to demonstrate a Yet in their failure to tackle the system itself, these communities strangled by the ever-growing amoral beast of capitalism. In contrast, there were revolutionary movements, initially based in Europe, that sought to gain power for workers through struggle.

These movements also co-existed usually not very well) revolutionary anarchists who envisioned the immediate end of not only capitalism, but any governmental/state system. was also the 19th century that the first great experiment in the of a state took place during the short-lived Paris Commune 1871.

For the of this essay, let us say that revolutionary transformation proved to be far more than the overthrow of a particular state structure.

He envisages in the following manner. \"(1) Bullets are fired by a man who the centre of a target, which we will call its 11f, and we will suppose the marks that the bullets make to be painted red, for the sake of distinction. The system of lateral of these red marks from the centre M will be approximately Normal, whose Q [Probable Error] will c.

Now if the lateral distance of a particular green mark from M given what is probable distance from M of the red mark at which was aimed?

Hence the regression of relative second relative = rc/ Jc2 + b2 x a = ~ + b2 x Again the variance of the difference in character between the two relatives = c2 + (c2 + b2) - 2c1/c2 + b2 r = b2, or b has for physical meaning probable error of the distribution of the difference in character between the two relatives.",

Upon his return to Williamsburg, the volunteer company of militia of the city offered him its protection in an address that concluded: \"May heaven grant you long to live the father country – and the friend to freedom and humanity!\" his friend George Washington succeeded him America’s patriarch, Randolph did as much as any Virginian to bring the new nation the world. He presided every important Virginia assembly in the years to the Revolution, was among the first of the men oppose the Stamp Act, chaired the first meeting of delegates of 13 colonies at Philadelphia in 1774, and chaired the second in 1775. was born years the Second Continental Congress – probably in Williamsburg in 1721 – second son of Sir John and Lady Susannah Randolph. His first name was his maternal grandmother's maiden name, just as his older brother was their mother's. The Randolph identified him as a scion of Virginia's most clan. When Peyton was three four years old, the family moved into imposing home on Market Square now known as the Peyton House. His father, among Virginia's most distinguished attorneys, Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and a wealthy man, died when Peyton was 16, leaving the house and other for him in trust with his mother. The will also gave Peyton father's extensive library in the hope he would \"betake himself to the study of law.\" By then, he had a brother John and a sister Study of law Attentive to his father's wishes, Peyton Randolph attended the College of William & Mary, then learned the law in London's of Court. entered the Middle Temple October 13, 1739, and took a place at the bar February 10, 1743. Returning to Williamsburg, he was appointed the colony's attorney general by Governor William Gooch on May 7, 1744. His father filled the office before him, and his brother would assume the role after. At the age of 24, Randolph eligible for his inheritance. On March 8, 1746, married Betty and on July 21 (more than two after his return from London), he qualified for the private practice of law in York County. His cousin Thomas Jefferson may have shed some on the delay in a sketch he wrote of Randolph years later. was indeed a most excellent man,\" Jefferson said, but \"heavy and inert in body, was rather too indolent and careless for business.\" He was, as well, occupied with myriad public duties. In 1747, he became a vestryman Bruton Parish and in 1748, he became Williamsburg's representative in the House of Burgesses, and in 1749, a justice of the peace. Randolph returned to the house in 1752 as the burgess for college William & Mary and on December 15, 1753, the house hired him its special agent some “ticklish business” in London. Soon after he arrived in Virginia in 1751, Governor Robert Dinwiddie had begun to exercise a no governor before him had tried: the imposition of a fee for certifying land patents. For his signature, Dinwiddie pistole, a Spanish coin worth about 20 shillings. Regarding the fee as an unauthorized tax, Virginians objected, though to no avail. Peyton Randolph was dispatched to England as the house's agent, with directions to go over the governor's head. But as attorney general, it was his duty to represent the interests of the Crown, of which Dinwiddie was the principal representative in Virginia. Randolph was attacking the right of the governor he was appointed to defend! The governor refused to give Peyton Randolph permission to leave the colony, but he left anyway. In London, he had to answer his action, and he was ousted from the attorney general's Dinwiddie had named George Wythe as acting attorney general in Randolph's place. Nevertheless, the London officials pointedly suggested that Dinwiddie reconsider said that they would have to Peyton Randolph's reinstatement if he So he did, subsequently resumed office soon his return to Williamsburg.

India: India scores bad on both \"Political participation,\" and culture.\" So these countries have good governments, but are certain issues typically related to the political culture that bring their overall score down and make them flawed democracies according to index. |show 2 more comments| Democracy, this index in particular, mostly refers to participation in the governments system of elections.

They have given me permission to use their cases as an example, so I am not confidence. Joseph is a 26-year-old teacher at a mission school. I never met him, but we corresponded for almost three years. He wrote me after he had read my book I Girl:Three years ago I married a 15 year-old person. I have ten years of schooling, my wife only six. God blessed us one year ago with a I purposely did not a. girl with a higher of education, for I intended to educate my wife in that she become exactly as I wanted her to be in her work and cleanliness, in whole life. But she does not satisfy me any more with her obedience. not do what I command her to I quarrel. I ask you a solution to save this young marriage. In order to help Joseph we have to understand his way of thinking. For him, marriage is an alliance with an inferior being. For him, a woman is primarily a garden. Man is then primarily of the seed of life. Such is mutual destiny. Their destiny decides their function. Their function defines their relationship. According this conception the woman can never be as important as the man, any more than the soil can be as important as the seed. By her nature, secondary, auxiliary. This is root of discrimination between man and woman that has shaped the history of mankind, not in Africa, but also Asia and -- until recently -- in Europe and America. This conception of marriage is not only based on a wrong and inaccurate biology. also in accordance with the New Testament which conceives husband and wife as partners before God. My task was to change Joseph's of marriage. Here is my answer:Joseph, you have not married wife. You have married a You were for a maid, obedient to your commandments. She was 15 when you married her. Now she is 18. In these three years she has developed from girl to a In addition she has become a This has changed her personality completely. She wants to treated a person. She wants to become your partner . . . It strikes me that your quarreling started after God gave you a baby. long is the period of lactation in your tribe? Could it be that your quarreling has a deeper reason? It is not God's will a married couple to abstain from physical union for such a long time.Joseph's answer came are exactly right . . . It is true that from sex relations for two years after the birth of a child ... This habit is incorporated us. Otherwise we are afraid of losing baby, especially if the mother breast-feeds it and if is a boy . My father - in - law pointed this out to when our child was born. The practice of abstaining from relations during of lactation presupposes a polygamous society. According to the biological conception of marriage, man can have several gardens one after the other. A garden can have one proprietor only, Joseph wants to be a Christian. He has been his church that polygamy sin. But he has been left with this negative message. He has not received any positive advice on how to live with one wife as partner, has he been told how to space his children. It is that Joseph did confide his problem to his pastor. Evidently he did not any help the pastor. Still, Joseph looks for a counselor. He may find that in a questionable friend, one that is not even a Christian, and he may be to things which are poison for his marriage. The method our uses for their children -- complete -- will lead to an estrangement and husband and will slowly drift apart. Let us imagine Joseph would tried to solve his by second wife. It is evident that refusing communion as punishment for this action would have been the inadequate answer to his problem on how to space his children.

But we only get the message faster if the words are emotionally positive. The study included 66 healthy young men. They were told to consume no caffeine, nicotine or alcohol the hours before the experiment. The men randomly into 2 groups. One took a tablet containing 200 milligrams of coffee, about the amount in 3 cups of coffee. Each person in the other group received a placebo (fake) pill. Half an hour later, the men were given tests that involved being shown a series of real and invented They had to press buttons to indicate whether a word was real or not. Men who took the caffeine pills did this faster and more accurately for a positive connotation. They did not perform better than men who got the placebo pills for recognizing neutral or negative words. The journal PLoS One published study online. News wrote about it 8. Howard LeWine, M.D. Harvard Medical School Is the Doctor's Reaction? You hear people say things like talk to me. I haven't had my coffee yet.\" Researchers from Germany offer us new insight into we might feel that way. The study comes from the Department of Psychology at Ruhr In general, recognize and process the meaning of words faster if the words have a positive emotional slant. What these researchers found is that caffeine speeds that even more. But caffeine did not speed up how quickly people recognize and process emotionally neutral or negative Low doses of caffeine tend to put you in a more positive mood. Caffeine also helps mental and fewer errors. Now we can add the faster processing of positively charged emotional content. These are good explanations for you want that first cup of coffee before to anyone. How caffeine affects the brain is completely understood. But here is how experts explain it. Caffeine gets absorbed the stomach and small intestine. It enters the blood stream and is distributed throughout the body, including the brain. Once it reaches the brain, caffeine probably has multiple targets. But the main one seems to be adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a that dampens brain activity. This counters the action of another brain dopamine. Dopamine acts as a brain stimulant and mood enhancer. By hogging the adenosine receptor sites, caffeine doesn't allow adenosine to dampen brain This puts the balance in favor of dopamine. It to feeling more awake and with a more positive mood. What Changes Can I Make Now? Overall, coffee is generally safe when in moderation. But the key word is moderation. In some people, too much caffeinated coffee raise blood pressure. Teenagers seem to be more susceptible to an increase blood pressure from caffeine. also can interfere with well your body absorbs iron and calcium. But you need to drink a lot of coffee for it to greatly lower the amount of iron and in your bloodstream. And it's not the caffeine that interferes with the absorption. It's related to another ingredient in coffee called acid. So decaf coffee also will decrease absorption of these minerals. Depending on how you make your coffee, it can raise cholesterol levels a little. Again, it's not the caffeine that influences cholesterol levels. It's the oil from the bean. If you boil or press your coffee, then the coffee oil gets into brew. However, today most coffee in the United States is filtered through And filtered coffee does not increase cholesterol levels. So what's bottom line? If you are already a coffee drinker, it. If you don't drink coffee, processing of words that convey positive emotions is not a good enough reason to start. There's probably amount of coffee (and other drinks containing caffeine) that carries a risk of real health hazards. I am still as what that level an otherwise healthy My advice: If even one cup of coffee makes you jittery or anxious, or interferes with sleep, that is one cup too many. I am honest with patients.

Paul Tibbets, the pilot the Enola Gay, will also be out in force. Tibbets, echoing refrain made by President Harry Truman, insists that he never lost sleep over that decision. Interestingly, the 1952 Above and Beyond, on which Tibbets consulted, shows him unable to sleep on the night before the bombing of Hiroshima as he grappled with the consequences of what he was about to do. As historian Peter Kuznick explains, those consequences included not only wanton slaughter of over 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the condemning of additional scores of thousands to a life of torment, but the inauguration of nuclear era in a fashion that Truman and others understood could ultimately end on the planet.

For the 10 or 12 years after war, nobody wanted to revisit the Manhattan Project and the two atomic bombs it produced -- at least not publicly.

Ever since, he's talked about the special B-29 developed under his supervision to Little Boy, and details about the bombing run into Japanese skies. That bombing has ranked as the most important news of the 20th century, that changed humankind forever, Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at University in Washington, D.C. As scholar who believes it probably wasn't necessary to drop the atomic bomb to end WWII, Kuznick the ultimate lesson about the event is that once such terribly effective weapons are developed, they likely be used. debates and a of potential long-term problems won't be enough to prevent their use, just as they enough to stop President Harry S. Truman from giving the order to drop the bomb. \"He it wasn't just another bomb. He knew it wasn't a bigger, more terrible bomb.

Persecution of and against the have been the historical reasons for and settlements around the world. Jews of arrived on the continent at 2,000 years ago during the early days of the empire. Since then, they have a significant influence in the history and culture of Europe. Much of what is considered \"Jewish\" today its roots among the Jews. One of the unique features among European is the distinction between the Ashkenazic Jews and the Sephardic Jews. The word is derived from a Biblical word for the larger Germanic region of Europe. Therefore, Ashkenazim Jews are those whose ancestry is linked to that area. This group traditionally speaks the Yiddish language, which a German dialect that has Hebrew and Slavic elements. The word was the name used by Jews in medieval times for the Iberian peninsula. Sephardim Jews, then, are the descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain or Portugal prior to expulsion in 1492 King Ferdinand and Sephardim also have distinctive language called Ladino, or Judeo-Spanish. This is a dialect of Castilian Spanish with Hebrew and Turkish elements. What are their lives like? During the last few centuries, Eastern Europe had the largest Jewish population in the world. National attitudes the Jews were ambivalent, on usefulness of the Jewish inhabitants to the nations' rulers. Anti-Semitism was prevalent and frequently led to persecution or The Holocaust of World War II was the climax of Jewish persecution in Europe, leading to the extermination of six million Many Eastern European countries lost the majority of their population in this tragedy. As a result of the Holocaust, thousands of Jewish survivors and their descendants have emigrated from Eastern Europe to Israel, the United States, or Western The recent memories of the Holocaust as well as the centuries discrimination persecution play a strong part in modern identity. European Jews are supporters of \"Zionism,\" a revival Jewish culture and of Israel as national, secure, Jewish homeland. Since the dissolution of the Soviet former Soviet Jews no longer live under oppressive government rule. Anti-Semitism is still a concern, but Jewish life has been revitalized in recreated countries like the Ukraine. Synagogues are functioning and kosher (traditional, food is once available. The Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe is cause for concern among the remaining aged Jewish As the older Jews die, the Jewish community dwindles. Many of the younger Jews are unlearned in their Jewish identity. They are non-observant or have assimilated into prevailing culture. However, strong efforts are being made to maintain a Jewish presence and clarify their identity. Jewish schools are being opened and Judaic studies are being promoted in universities. Jewish hospitals and retirement are being built. Community centers also promote cultural events such as the Israeli dance, theater, Yiddish and Hebrew lessons, and sports. Western Europe now has the largest concentration of European Jewish residents. The Netherlands received a large influx Sephardic Jews from Portugal the late 1500's, and another contingent of Ashkenazic after War II. They have very influential in the development of Dutch commerce. England's Jews are concentrated in the Greater London area and been politically active for over 100 years.

The place is Indo-China, a jungle, mountain and delta land includes the Republic of Nam and smaller neighboring Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, all parts of the French Union. For more than years this land, in prewar times rich French colony of Indo-China, has been suffering, on a lesser scale, ruinous kind of war which won China for Communism. The Tse-tung of the Indo-Chinese is a frail, but comrade, who looks like a shriveled wizard; his nom de guerre is Ho Chi (or One Who Shines). Chiang Kai-shek no counterpart in Indo-China. The initial brunt of the Red attack has been borne by soldiers. Meanwhile, the of rallying native anti-Communist falls mainly on the meaty shoulders Emperor Bao Dai (or Guardian of Greatness), who now bears the official of of State of Viet Nam. While the dust of the Chinese civil war was settling before the eyes of the State Department, the U.S. paid attention to the Indo-Chinese struggle. It seemed largely a local affair between the French and their subjects. Since the dust has settled in China, Asia’s Communism is thrusting Indo-China first on the path to Singapore, Manila and the Indies (see map). Last January, led by Peking and Moscow, the world’s Communist bloc recognized Ho Chi Minh’s “Democratic Republic.” It was more than the Kremlin had ever done for Communist rebels Greece. Over the several weeks, arms and other were reported passing from Russia and China to the comrades in Indo-China. The stakes in Southeast Asia were big—as big as the global struggle between Communism and freedom. A fortnight ago in Paris, U.S. Secretary of Acheson drew a line in the dust that has so long beclouded U.S. diplomacy. He implicitly recognized that the war in Indo-China is no local shooting match. He pledged military and economic aid to the French and Vietnamese. The U.S. thus up the Russian gauntlet. What kind of frontier and what kind of ally had history for the U.S.? Golden Asset. Unlike China, where U.S. traders and missionaries began a fruitful acquaintance more than a ago, Indo-China has had contact with either commercial, cultural or diplomatic.* The last comprehensive U.S. book on the country was published 1937. Among things, its author “IndoChina lies far off scene of action to play but a secondary role in Pacific drama.” In pre-French past, most of Indo-China had been conquered by the Chinese, had culture the last half of 19th. Century, the French converted Indo-China into a tight, profitable colonial monopoly. They explored its fever-laden jungles, lofty ranges, great river valleys. They discovered its antiquities, including the majestic loth Century of Angkor Wat in northern Cambodia. wrote about its mandarins, its Buddhist temples and Confucian family life. The French invested billion, built up Indo-China’s rice and rubber production; before War II, the colony, with Siam and Burma, was one the world’s three leading rice exporters. Its surplus went to rice-short China, a fact of great significance these days in Communist support of Communist Ho Chi Minh. All the raw rubber France needed came from Indo-China. There were other lucrative coal, wolfram, pepper, opium (which, to French shame, was sold to the natives through a state monopoly) and many jobs a white bureaucracy. politicians called the colony balcony on the Pacific.” A Dangerous Liability. Indo-China no longer a golden asset for France. As everywhere in the East, old colonialism has died beneath the impact of Western egalitarian ideas, a greatly hastened by the Japanese march in World War under slogan “Asia for the Asiatics.” The French have bowed grudgingly the In an agreement signed March 8, 1949 Bao Dai, they promised limited freedom for Viet Nam within the French Union.

By that time the French were up to their necks in a campaign to crush Ho Minh and his bid for power.

Testosterone, which plays an important role in sexual development, is produced mainly by the testes in boys and in much amounts by the ovaries in girls. Testosterone is by the adrenal glands in both girls and boys. young boys, testosterone are normally low. As puberty approaches — usually between the ages 10 and 14 — the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland near base of the brain) secretes two hormones hormone, or LH; and follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH) that together to stimulate the testes to make testosterone. Increased testosterone production is what causes to develop deeper voices, muscles, and body and facial hair. It also the testes produce sperm, and it plays role in speeding a boy's growth in height during puberty. Two assessments may be performed as part of a testosterone test: total testosterone, which measures amount of testosterone in the body, including both the bound to proteins that help transport the hormone through the bloodstream and free testosterone free testosterone, which measures only the testosterone that's not attached to proteins The doctor may order one or both tests. However, because sexual development involves many other hormones, a more complete picture can often be obtained by performing other tests at the time, including an LH or FSH test. For example, low levels testosterone be due a problem with testes' production of testosterone or to the pituitary not making enough of hormones stimulate testes to produce testosterone. Why It's Done Doctors may order testosterone blood test if a appears to be puberty earlier or later than High are associated with precocious (early) puberty, while low levels may indicate a delay in sexual In girls, high levels can associated with appearance of masculine such as facial hair. The test may also be used in either boys or girls to check for damage or disease of the ovaries, adrenal glands, or gland, or to check for steroid use. In teens and adults, testosterone levels can doctors evaluate fertility or menstrual problems and sexual function. No preparations are for test. The doctor want to perform the test in the morning, when testosterone levels usually are highest. On day of the test, may help have child wear a shirt to allow easier access for the who will be drawing the blood. A health clean the skin surface with antiseptic, and place an elastic band (tourniquet) around the upper arm to apply pressure and cause the veins to swell with blood. Then a needle is inserted into a vein (usually in the arm inside of the elbow or on back of the hand) and blood is withdrawn and collected in a vial or syringe. After the procedure, the band is removed. Once blood has been collected, the needle is removed and the area is covered with cotton or a bandage to stop the bleeding. Collecting blood for this test will only take a few minutes. What to Expect Collecting a sample of blood is only uncomfortable and can feel like a pinprick. Afterward, there may be some mild bruising, which should go away in a few days. The blood sample will be by a machine the results are commonly available after a few days. The testosterone test is considered a safe procedure. However, as with medical tests, some problems can occur with having blood drawn: fainting or lightheaded hematoma (blood the skin a lump bruise) pain associated with multiple punctures to locate a vein Your a blood test is painless. Still, many children are of needles. Explaining the test in terms your child can understand might help ease some of the fear. Allow your child to ask the technician any questions he or might have.

Montana State University Nitrogen (N) is the most nutrient that limits oat production in Montana. Deficiency symptoms are frequently characterized general chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves and reduction in overall plant vigor and growth. Oat deficiency symptoms, as with cereal grains, will most often appear in the early to late spring depending on present, symptoms become more severe through vegetative growth stages. At flowering, N deficient plants are stunted and have fewer tillers and smaller heads than healthy plants. Grain yield is reduced primarily through a reduction in kernels per head and head density. Nitrogen typically represents a grower's input cost. Current N recommendations Montana are an average relationship N requirement and estimated yield potential [Yield potential (bu/a) x 1.1 = (lbs/a)] (Table 1). The recommendation assumes 1.1 lbs N/a are needed to produce bushel of grain. However, this relation may vary with season the yield potential at an individual site. Since yield potential is most closely associated with water (stored soil water + growing precipitation), were interested in determining the effects of available water on the N requirement and oat yield potential. Field experiments on a Lohmiller silty clay loam (Ustic Torrifluvents) at the Southern Agricultural Research Center near Huntley during 1993 and 1994. Initial soil N levels (0-36 in. depth) were 15 and 22 lbs/a in 1993 and 1994. Field experiments were to barley. A line-source irrigation system was used establish a water gradient in the oats planted in April at 18 seeds per square foot. Stripped at angles to the water gradient were six N (0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 N/a). The combined treatments produced a field site with a wide range of water and conditions. Table 1. Predicted N requirements for oats with growing season water. |Growing season water||Yield potential||Available N requirement||N:yield ratio| expected, available water increased yield and the response to N. high water stress, the response to N was small and potential was low, producing a comparatively flat curve. As water conditions improved, the response to N increased, producing steeper curve that reached a higher (Figure 1). Yield potential at the levels, or where N was no longer limiting yields, similar for the two growing seasons. However, oat without N higher 1994 than 1993. This difference may been a result of greater N mineralization organic matter in 1994, resulting in less N deficiency where no fertilizer N was Maximum economic yield (MEY) was defined as the point along the yield-N curves (Figure 1) where in N longer paid for themselves through higher yield (< 1 bushel in yield resulted from 4 additional or where dollars returned from N was maximized. economic yields were generally within 2% of the theoretical maximum, hence provide good estimate of yield potential. The MEY-available water relationships (Figure 2) yield potential increased linearly with water in both 1993 and 1994. The relationships that takes 4 to 5 in. of water to produce the first bushel of oat, and thereafter yield increases 12 to 14 bu/a each inch water. Available N requirements (soil N + N) for MEY increased linearly with water both growing seasons. The slopes of the lines for the two seasons were similar and indicate that N requirements increased approximately 8 lbs N with each inch additional water. the the lines differ for the two seasons. a result, took approximately 35 to 40 lbs/a less N in 1994 to achieve MEY than in 1993 at similar water levels. Background soil N analysis levels for the two seasons were similar. However, barley residue from the preceding crop was burned to seeding the 1994 oat crop. This likely enhanced organic N mineralization and resulted in the lower calculated N requirement. Typically, most cereal do not burn their residue, under most situations the upper line in Figure probably the better of fertilizer N Using this approach, sufficient fertilizer should applied to achieve lbs available N/a where 8 inches of available water (soil rainfall) is expected during the growing season.

A literature review discusses published information in a particular subject area, and sometimes information in a particular subject area within a certain time period. A literature review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it usually has an organizational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organization, or a that information. It might a interpretation of old material or combine new with old Or it the intellectual progression of the field, including major debates. And depending on the situation, the literature review may evaluate the sources the reader on the most pertinent or relevant. But how is a literature review different from an academic research paper? While the main of academic research paper is to support your own argument, the focus a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the arguments and ideas others. The academic paper also covers a range of sources, but it is usually a select number of sources, because the emphasis is the argument. Likewise, a review can also have an but it is not as important as covering a number of sources. short, an academic research paper and a literature contain some the same elements. In fact, academic research papers will a literature review section. But it is aspect of the study (the argument or the sources) that is emphasized that what of document it is. Why do write literature reviews? reviews provide you with a handy guide to a particular topic. If you have limited time conduct research, literature reviews give an overview or act as a stepping stone. For professionals, they are useful reports keep them to date with what current the field.

But we to away from an environment because we do not it and without trying to live in it while not of it, we are not altering ourselves but simply altering the circumstances, and may not always gain anything. Questioner: What is your attitude to the early teachings of Theosophy, the Blavatsky type? Do you consider we have or advanced? KRISHNAMURTI: I afraid I do because I do not know what Madame Blavatsky's are. Why should I? Why should you know of someone else's teachings? know, there is only truth, and therefore is only one way, which is not distant from the truth; there is only one method to that truth, because the means are not distinct from end. Now you who have studied Madame Blavatsky's and the latest Theosophy, or whatever it is, why do you want be students of books instead of students of life? Why you set up leaders and ask whose teachings are better? Don't you see? Please, I am being harsh, or anything of that kind. Don't you see? You are Christians; find out what is true and false in Christianity—and you will then find what is true. Find out what is true and false in your environment with all its oppressions and cruelties, then you will find out what is true. do want philosophies? Because life is an ugly thing, and you hope to run away from it Life is so empty, dull, stupid, ignominious, and you want to bring romanticism into your world, some hope, some lingering, haunting feeling; whereas, really faced the world as it is, and it, you would find it something much more, infinitely greater than any philosophy, greater than any book in the world, greater than any teaching or than any teacher. We have really lost all of feeling, feeling for the oppressed, and feeling for oppressor. You only feel when you are oppressed. So gradually we have intellectually explained away all our feelings, our sensitiveness, our delicate perceptions, until are absolutely shallow; and fill that shallowness, to enrich ourselves, study books. The Theosophical Society has had three objects for more than a century. They are: Of these three objects the first has been considered most important, at least since the time H.P. Blavatsky and H.S. Olcott arrived in India in 1879. Strangely the 'mission-statement' of the Theosophical Society in Wheaton (Adyar) rephrases the above, but leaves brotherhood out. It is as follows: To encourage open-minded enquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation. A mission statement is merely another word for aim or object. So would expect the three objects of the Theosophical Society to agree precisely with the mission-statement. One would expect the wording of the mission-statement to be more modern. that vein it would have a nice challenge if the board of directors of the US-section of the TS had found a new way of saying that people should treat each other well. else a 'nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity (etc)' mean? But to leave it all out is really going far for me, and for several of the people I met in Wheaton this This mission-statement sounds selfish to me. Great: I find an organisation where people will help me with self-transfor",

I tried to solve for x and y and got x = + ky and y = (-1/k) + (-x/k) but now I do not know what to do with this. So I was wondering if you knew how to go about solving this? Date: at Doctor Peterson Subject: Re: To state the geometric property of an equation Hi, Mara. I don't think is any method you can use to solve this sort of without a lot of thinking and Let's see how I personally would approach (as well as I can construct it, considering that I know answer already!). Then look at some you might take. have x ky = 1 and we want to know what property all these lines have in Probably, since this an open-ended question I don't expect it to be straightforward, I would start by just \"playing\" with the equation, getting a feel for how it works by trying a few special cases. I might take k = 0, 1, and -1 and graph those = 1 x - y = 1 x + y = 1 I would find that they all intersect at (1,0), and my answer would be that all the lines seem to contain (In a sense this is a more purely \"geometric\" property than the x-intercept, since it does not refer to the coordinates.) Then I would want to prove that is true for ALL k, to make sure I hadn't myself by choosing three cases that happened to intersect. Thinking of this as point shared by all lines in the family, would prove it by substituting x=1, y=0 in general equation: x ky = 1 1 - k*0 = 1 is true for k so (1,0) is indeed on lines, not just the three I tried. Or, I might think of it as a common x-intercept, as you said; then I would you suggested and put the equation into two-intercept form x/a + y/b = 1 That's easy; all takes is to interpret -ky as y divided by -1/k: x/1 + y/(-1/k) = 1 So the x-intercept is for all these lines, and the y-intercept -1/k. So my approach is to experiment (the more adult word for \"play\"!) and make a conjecture (the more adult word \"guess\"), and then prove that conjecture. Now, is there way might approach this? If you were really smart (and I might possibly have this I were faced with the afresh), you could just see that looks like the two-intercept form, and directly to the proof. If you could do that, fine; but you can't depend on such insight! You might instead just go through form of the equation, starting probably with slope-intercept, and see whether any important feature as slope or y-intercept) is constant. When failed, it would hard to move on to the or two-point form, because you would have to choose the point(s), and there is no for that choice. So you would probably next try the two- intercept form (which studuents see, so you're lucky). Your approach came close. When you solved for x, you just had to and see that the x-intercept (the constant that form) is 1. But that form, the slope-x-intercept form, is little-known, it's not surprising that not know what to with it. But I really think that my approach is the most hope to find the answer quickly.

Planet j is at origin. Planet k is one unit to the right of j on the x axis, while planet l is one unit the axis. If the masses all equal 1, then, by the formula force planet would be: is a function of both the and the position, right? So we must consider not only Gravitational Forces individually exerted upon j by k and l, but also the angle at which these forces are exerted. That is, we must add the vectors. To add vectors you just plug in the x value and y value sums of the added vectors into formula. The force on planet j should therefore be: (Where is the angle subtended by a line drawn from planet j to planet x. I.e. and ) So, what am missing here?

Three new studies American, Belgian, British and Dutch researchers are bolstering a long-debated idea: that tumors contain their own pool of stem cells that can multiply and keep fueling the cancer, seeding regrowth. that's will need to way to kill cells, apart from how they attack the rest of the tumor. Stem cells in healthy tissues are known for their ability to any kind of cell. The new research deals with a different kind, cancer stem cells. Some researchers, but not all, believe they lurk as a persisting feature in Over past decade, studies have found evidence for them in like breast and colon cancers. this research has largely depended on transplanting cancer cells into mice that don't have immune an artificial environment that raises questions about the relevance of the results. Now, studies reported online Wednesday in the journals Nature and evidence for cancer cells within the original tumors. the research relies on mice. That and other factors mean the new still won't convince everyone cancer cells are key to finding more powerful treatments. But Luis Parada, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, his team is onto something. He says that for the type of brain tumor his team studied, \"we've identified the true enemy.\" If his finding applies to other cancers, he said, then even chemotherapy drastically shrinks a tumor but doesn't affect supply of cancer stem cells, \"very little progress has actually made.\" The three studies used labeling techniques to trace the ancestry of cells within tumors. Collectively, they give \"very strong support\" to the cancer stem cell theory, said Jeffrey M. Rosen, a professor of molecular and cellular Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He did not participate in the work but supports the which he said widely accepted. Parada's team worked mice genetically primed to develop a certain brain tumor. The scientists genetically labeled particular cells in the tumor then attacked the cancer with the same drug given to human patients. It growing tumor cells and temporarily stops the cancer's After treatment, when the tumor started growing again in the mice, the researchers showed that the vast majority, if not all, of its new cells descended from the labeled cells. Apparently these were the tumor's cancer stem cells, they concluded. Parada said his team is now to isolate cancer stem from brain cancers to study them and perhaps get leads for developing to He also said that preliminary study human brain tumors is producing results consistent with what his team found in the mice.

And as for Parada's brain cancer study, said he believed the results could be explained without relying the cancer stem cell theory. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Data that more than 180,000 American women received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2009. The various risk factors include: the female gender, heredity, genetic factors, aging and idiopathic causes. What You Should About Breast Cancer The short answer to what should about breast cancer is that a tumor in the breast tissue. With non-invasive breast cancer, the tumor stays localized and does not spread (metastasize) from its origin growth. Experts refer to this as “Carcinoma in Situ”. The tumor occurs in and remains confined to the ducts (ductal carcinoma situ) or confined to the lobules (lobular carcinoma in situ). “Duct” and “Lobules” refer to the milk duct the milk glands, respectively, in the mammary glands. Most breast cancers start in the ducts to other tissues. carcinoma doesn’t meet the criteria of a true cancer by itself, but is a for other types of cancer – both and non-invasive. An invasive spreads beyond its area of origin and can have three different stages of – regional distant As the suggest localized types those which remain localized to the breast tissues, the regional stage refers to the of the tumor to tissues the breast (e.g. – lymph nodes) and the distant tumors are those spread away from the breast to tissues organs. to patients with distant tumors are not easily managed. About Breast Cancer Stages Doctors breast cancer stages on the tumor size, nodal status (involvement lymph nodes) and degree of spread (metastasis) tumors are grouped into 5 stages 0 IV. Stage zero means the cells confined to the duct or lobule and not spread This is the foremost stage of breast cancer. In stage I the tumor is very – less than or equal to 2 cm in and is confined to an area in the not spread to the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues. In stage II, the tumor grows to 1-2 inches in diameter and cancer cells appear at the lymph nodes. Sometimes the tumor is even bigger than 5cms, but the lymph nodes remain unaffected. In the tumor grows more than 5 cm and spreads to the lymph nodes sometimes to multiple lymph nodes, skin chest wall. Stage IV is the last one and in this case the spreads to somewhere else in the body. Tests for Breast Cancer A biopsy of the tumor determines the type of cancer. This enables the doctors to freeze on the treatment methods and also to figure out how quickly the cancer might grow. The hormone receptor status HER2 status of the patient is also of importance to the doctors, female hormones estrogen and progesterone play a vital role in the development of cancer types. “ER+” and “PR+” are, respectively, estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive tumors. Hormonal therapy has been found to be beneficial in patients with tumors. HER2 status also influences the mode of treatment. Therapy and of Breast The most used breast treatment methods include mastectomy and lumpectomy The former refers to the removal of entire breast surgery and the latter refers to the of only the tumor and some surrounding tissues believed to contain the roots of tumor. As is the case with cancer types, the cancer cells in breast cancer are too tiny for detection and doctors cannot rule out the chances that some cells will remain in body, even after successful surgery. The leftover cells can cause recurrence. To rule out recurrence adjuvant therapies are Such therapies include: - Hormonal therapy - Targeted biological therapy In chemotherapy, the oncology health care team will administer a chemical to the patient (usually intravenously, sometimes orally) to disrupt communication and growth of the cancerous cells. Hormonal involves dosing patient with a drug that works to bring down the estrogen levels or reduce its action. Experts believe estrogen promotes growth in some In biological therapy, doctors inject the body with monoclonal trained to recognize and destroy certain proteins and cells (the cancerous cells) through (mechanism of through immune system).

Once it was well established and the roads were cleared and expanded, once towns had grown along the route and locations the Rockies and west were settled, it was only natural that a new method of transportation would take over: stagecoaches. The behind stagecoaches wasn’t new. Carriages were the primary form of mass transportation in the pre-locomotive age. made stagecoaches different from regular carriages were size and the way they were supported on the wheel frame. Rather than relying on springs, which jostled a rider up and down, stagecoaches use of thoroughbraces, leather straps that supported the body of the and gave more of a rocking motion.Stagecoaches could generally fit passengers inside six outside. Inside, as you can probably guess, meant that passengers traveled inside the body of would ride on three benches, and the foremost one facing backwards, three riders to a bench. As you can imagine, it was a tight squeeze. Passengers in the two benches would often have to knees between another to make room. They would carry their baggage and have mail under their feet. But if that wasn’t bad enough, six passengers riding outside of the carriage would be just as cramped and exposed to the But passengers lost in comfort, they made up for in speed. The most common type of stagecoach was the Concord stagecoach, manufactured in Concord, New Hampshire. These stagecoaches rarely broke down. They were drawn by a team horses and could cut through the new roadways of the west much faster than any wagon ever could. is part of the reason that almost all carried mail as well as passengers. More than mail, in fact. It was common for stagecoaches to carry gold and cash being transported on behalf of one bank or another. This, of course, meant there was a real danger of robberies along the road. The first major stagecoach robbery in California took place in 1852 when Reelfoot Williams and gang robbed a Nevada City coach. The gang had up a network of to when stages were coming and what money and passengers they were carrying. They carried off the setting a precedent that many would follow. For that reason, and because of the very real threat of attacks by Native Americans, passengers were advised to carry guns and knives with them and drivers were well armed. So, you might ask yourself. Who was in charge of all these stagecoaches? You probably already know the answer without knowing it. There were several stagecoach in the east that been in operation even before 19th century. But one of the and most successful companies developed in the 1830s as a service to deliver packages between Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Adams & Company gradually moved west as steamships replaced routes for fast transportation between the major eastern cities. Adams & Company did well in after the gold rush, until mismanagement and the emergence of a serious competitor changed everything. That competitor was a little company started by men, Henry Wells and G. Fargo. The company that Wells Fargo started offered more than just service. It offered banking and mail services as well. In fact, by the the 1850s rolled around, Wells Fargo was known to be and more reliable about delivering the than the U.S. Postal service. Then came the of 1855. The banking system, puffed up on speculation of continued profits from the Gold Rush, collapsed. Many businesses, Adams & Company, folded. But Wells Fargo managed to hold on. Not only did it hold on, it emerged as one of only viable options in stagecoach transportation. Since Fargo much had a monopoly on stagecoach transportation in the west after 1855, they could make the rules. And some of those rules were: Abstinence from liquor is but if you must share the bottle.

People from Cloud to Faribault, the Twin Cities Eau Claire had no electricity for up to three hours. For most, was simply inconvenient. But for a few young heart patients connected to pacemakers it was life-threatening. The blackout did spur the creation the portable, battery-powered pacemaker. Minn. — At the University of Minnesota hospital 50 years ago, had recently started using pacemakers to help children recover from heart surgery. The devices plugged into a wall socket, so when the power went out in patients' rooms, their pacemakers stopped working too. It's hard to piece together exactly what was like at the hospital during the blackout. But what can be from old newspaper accounts paints a frenzied picture, according to historian Jack Norton. \"They police officers pull up to side of the surgery suites and simply turn their headlights to provide light for the surgeons,\" says Norton. \"They scrambled try and keep blood cold grabbing ice from various coolers stick in the blood refrigerator.\" Norton dug up dozens of newspaper stories about the blackout while doing research for Medtronic. He says the articles show that the university hospital no reason to suspect it was vulnerable to a power because it was connected to two different power \"They thought if of them went down, the other would provide them with electricity,\" But this was a rolling blackout that took down plants all across power grid. No anticipated that happening, Norton says. \"It's a nightmare scenario and there's a certain amount of irony that it happens Halloween, that this nightmare critical care happens day when we all know it's famed for scary happenings.\" Probably the scariest place to be that morning was the children's cardiac recovery unit. A number of young kids were connected to pacemakers undergoing heart surgery. When the power went off, doctors scrambled drugs to their patients hearts pumping. Still, one child didn't survive the three hour ordeal. The trauma of that event pioneering University of Minnesota heart surgeon C. Lillehei. day in hospital hallway Lillehei flagged down Earl Bakken, an electrical engineer who spent a lot of his time collaborating with university surgeons on medical devices. Bakken had just started Medtronic a few and was still running the company out of his garage. Bakken says Lillehei clearly troubled about the blackout. \"We got and talked about it and said we have to have some way to back these pacemakers up when there's a power failure,\" Bakken said in a recent interview. Lillehei asked Bakken if could create a portable pacemaker that ran on a \"So we talked about how we do that? How do we get the battery backup?,\" Bakken. \"And I said, 'Well, we'll take a six volt automobile battery and then an to convert the six volts to 115 volts to run the pacemaker.'\" Bakken and a his employees built the device. Bakken says it would have but the car battery produced more power than he needed pacemaker. So he started looking for alternatives. Then he an article he read in his Popular Electronics It was about new circuit for a metronome. \"A metronome has the same rates as heart rates,\" says The metronome circuit also had the being much smaller. Bakken's invention fit in box about size of a small paperback book, which meant the pacemaker could be placed in the bed with the patient, rather on medical cart next bed. Bakken took his new invention to the University Minnesota and tested it out on laboratory dog that had given an artificial heart block. 'Okay now. This seems to work, I'll go back to my garage and a pacemaker can use on humans,'\" Bakken. But he never got the When Bakken returned to the hospital the next day, he saw his invention being used in the recovery \"There was a child in there with this pacemaker connected to him...What a great feeling that is to see here's something hands keeping this child alive.\" Still Bakken wasn't convinced his portable pacemaker was really ready for human use. sought out Lillehei and asked him why he didn't for the human version of the machine. \"And he said well as long as this battery operated pacemaker was available he wasn't going risk losing another child to a power failure.\" Bakken says it was probably inevitable that a portable would have the 1950's even if hadn't created the Surgeons at the",

The recent death Lonesome George, famed Galapagos tortoise believed to the last representative of his subspecies, has many experts wondering how we should try to save other endangered and at-risk Cloning is one option. While cloning methods for reptiles are not as advanced as those for mammals, also they face other incredible obstacles. \"At the most, I could envision one turtle of this cloned in future or maybe two males, but where going to get female?\" Martha Gomez, a senior scientist with the Audubon Nature Institute, which one world's few \"frozen zoos.\" Frozen Zoos stockpile materials from a wide variety of rare and critically endangered The biological material is usually composed of gametes (sperm and egg cells), embryos, tissue samples, serum and other items. Together, they represent bank vault of irreplaceable genetic information that can be preserved for possibly hundreds of years or more. In most the materials are stored in holding tanks filled with liquid nitrogen. Oliver Ryder, of genetics at the San Diego Zoo, spoke to Discovery News as his team was racing to the Galapagos to help preserve the tissues Lonesome George. The San Diego Zoo operates of the other few frozen zoos. \"This is an extremely urgent matter,\" Ryder said. \"We planned to meet in the Galapagos in two weeks to discuss preservation of the tortoises there. It is a bitter irony that Lonesome George died before we could even finish setting up the plans. It underscores the importance of preserving such animals.\" \"We are facing some logistical problems now, but we don't want to look back if's,'\" he added. \"This may be the chance we'll have to preserve, document and study this tortoise subspecies.\" Ryder discussions of cloning George are premature at this point. Before that takes he thinks more must be learned about this particular tortoise's physiology and reproduction. George's remains may also to reveal how tortoises often live to advanced ages, information that could one lead to breakthroughs in extending human lifespans. For cloning, researchers are focusing more on \"species where we have knowledge of their reproductive Ryder said. That is one reason why cats, dogs and mice were among the first animals to be cloned. Scientists are now working clone endangered relatives of such animals, in hopes of releasing those individuals into the wild to strengthen natural populations. Earlier this year, Gomez and her successfully cloned endangered black-footed cats. An endangered ox, called a and a banteng (wild cattle) have also been successfully Work is underway to clone and otherwise increase the population of Sumatran rhinos, which presently number only about 200-300 in the wild.

Gomez said that kittens of cloned wild cat parents have died \"due to with nuclear programing,\" but some normal kittens resulted and continue to thrive. Both she Ryder say that there is no international policy calling for cloning and preservation of highly endangered species. Instead, isolated facilities and work of dedicated individuals are responsible for the successes. \"The effort needs to be more widespread and organized,\" Gomez said. Through published papers and talks, Ryder and his have repeatedly called for organized global effort. It would need an \"overarching international body\" par with UNESCO, he believes. \"The first step is saving tissue samples, in the process of doing for Lonesome George,\" he said. \"But we who are among the would like to train others to establish frozen zoo biobanks in other countries.\" \"I am confident that day such an international structure will come together, bringing in other conservation work, such as preserving habitat,\" Ryder concluded. \"It's poignant to lose a subspecies like that of Lonesome George.

The Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are today synonyms for oil, but that could soon. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the monopoly of oil supply is contested by the United States which is on the way to become the largest oil exporter throughout the world by 2030. Meantime, Lebanon and Israel, two old arch-foes in the Middle East technically still at war, started digging deeply off Mediterranean coast in search oil and gas.

Justice and safety for American Women: Native American victims of violence often cannot seek justice because their courts are not to prosecute non-Native offenders -- for crimes committed on land. This major gap in justice, safety, and violence prevention must be addressed. VAWA 2013 includes a solution that would give Tribal courts the authority they to hold offenders in their communities accountable.

The law, did cover all federally subsidized housing programs. VAWA 2013 expands these protections to individuals in all federally subsidized housing programs, explicitly protects victims of sexual assault and creates emergency housing transfer options. Protections for immigrant survivors: VAWA 2013 maintains important protections for immigrant survivors of while also making key improvements to existing including by strengthening the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act and the provisions around self-petitions and U visas. Justice campuses: College students are mong thos emost vulnerable dating violence. Provisions in VAWA 2013 add additional for students requiring schools implement a for incidences of as well report the In addition, schools be required to plans to prevent this violence and educate victims on their rights and resources. Maintaining VAWA grant programs: VAWA grants are effectively meeting the needs of millions of victims across the country. VAWA 2013 includes many important improvements to grant programs, including allowing state domestic violence coalitions to be the lead applicant on the Grants to Encourage Arrest program; ensuring specific stakeholders, domestic coalitions, play a meaningful role in developing state STOP plans; and providing a formal process for on Violence Against Women to receive coalition other key domestic violence and sexual assault input.

The centre is run by Kinuthia Njoroge, who wanted to a traditional Kikuyu village to show local children the history and customs of their community. The Kikuyu are the largest community in Kenya, and have always played a central role in the development of the independent Nation. For this reason, many may believe that modern influence has eroded the way of life for this who mainly live around the capital city and the highlands. But as Riuki demonstrates, this is not case. While traditional and ceremonies may be displays of proud history, many of the same beliefs and customs persist in modern life. In cuisine, music, marriage and family life, most Kenyan still hold true to their identity. this that Riuki strives to encourage and strengthen, with its own blend the modern and traditional. Now visitors to Kenya can come to Riuki and spend a day learning more about this known culture.

He sent Gikuyu to grove of Fig trees, where he found a called Mumbi. This would become known as Mukuru wa Nyagathanga, the birthplace of all still revered as a sacred place. Among the fig trees, Gikuyu and Mumbi produced nine daughters- Wanjiku, Wanjiru, Wanjeri, Wambui, Wangari, Wacera, Waithera, Wairimu, and Nyambura.

Finally he bowed the Mountain, and him make sacrifice among the and light a fire. The sacrifice of a goat beneath a fig tree still considered a way to call rain in times of drought, but in this first case it was a different form of life sustaining rain Gikuyu sought. After the sacrifice he plunged nine sticks into fire, and prayed. The fire erupted into an inferno, from which nine strong young men emerged. Giving thanks, Gikuyu took them back to his daughters, the nine marriages were blessed by Each of the daughters made her own homestead, and nine separate clans of the were born. the unity these clans was known as the ya Mumbi, in honour of their The peak of Kirinyaga has since remained the sacred home of Ngai. at Riuki, all Kikuyu homesteads were traditionally to this Holy Mountain.

For those you who have them, oil prices rise to scarcity (real or not) or increased production costs, and the latter become important sometime around when oil production peaks. Also, the time for us to go through the second half of the world’s oil will be considerably less than the history of oil use to date, our transportation in particular is heavily oil-based. Among climate change scientists, seems to be less worry about running out of oil, and considerably more worry about its use. Recent readings have given me some understanding. David Greene, et al, from (pdf file) Out of and into Oil: Analyzing Global Oil Depletion and Transition 2050 “It is possible that world could go partway down the path of developing oil and later direction. But such a strategy would strand huge in the more capital-intensive production and refining of unconventional If the transition to unconventional oil is gradual, there might be time to introduce alternatives and a reversal might not be too costly. But if the transition to unconventional oil sudden and massive, the world’s economies quickly become locked a high carbon Avoiding or even slowing the transition to unconventional fossil resources might improve the of dealing with global climate change.” The unconventional sources to are coal to liquids (synfuel), example, or natural to liquids (isn’t all natural gas needed for electricity and heating?) Both increase carbon in of the needed to convert them to liquid. Both are expensive they require so much energy for the process. Oil prices will rise we hit a peak, but Europeans and others are already living with much higher gasoline prices. Detour: A vote on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is expected soon. understanding is that oil companies not particularly interested in drilling without some kind guarantee (a large guarantee, but that dissuade Congress?), there is relatively little oil, and relatively far from where it would be used. I’m not sure why anyone would vote for opening up the to oil drilling, both for practical reasons and because it’s nice to imagine those few places in the world not crowded us. What I hear is, “got you, you crummy environmentalists”, but perhaps legislators have other reasons, poorly to date. Certainly reasons have little to do with oil security, even the person who also votes to increase car mileage standards. That said, overwhelming concern to the is not the drilling, but use of oil. Climate change alters the environment at high altitudes faster, and status will not protect ANWR. Return: From my reading, it is apparent that the rest of the world, as non-OPEC is generally referred to, is running out of oil faster is OPEC. Fareed Zakaria in The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at and Abroad points out that governments that finance themselves without taxes are not as accountable to citizens. Hence is worldwide discomfort financing these governments. But the discomfort is not great enough here in the United States to taxing oil in order to encourage us to change our behavior. We would be much better off raising taxes on oil use today. Even a moderate tax, perhaps little as $1/gallon, will begin to shift behavior, to help stretch our current oil supply and allow the transitions away from fossil fuels, so that we don’t finance OPEC governments so heavily. Oh, I’ve heard many, particularly poor people, say, but we can’t afford it. Perhaps more earned income credit, or some other mechanism, could help the poor this transition, let choose whether to spend the money on a or bus. isn’t right to those who will be in a transition. But we are wrong if we do not transition. Some talk about making the carbon tax revenue neutral, idea I sympathetic to until the Bush deficits, and when I thought roads and bridges are for by the gasoline tax rather than out revenue. We could do more regional planning of mass transit systems. We could use some of the gasoline tax to pay for the roads and mass transit that our roads less crowded. We could teach bicycling as a PE as those who learn to bicycle and signal correctly are less dangerous to themselves and others and are more to continue bicycling as adults. would leave more oil for those of you who or don’t want bicycle.

Causes of Acrophobia Research shows that a certain amount of reluctance around heights is normal, not only for humans but for all visual animals. In 1960, research psychologists Gibson and Walk did a \"Visual Cliff\" experiment which showed crawling infants, along with babies of numerous species, who refused to cross a thick glass panel that covered an apparently sharp drop-off. The presence of the infant's mother, encouragingly calling him, did not convince the babies it was safe. Therefore, acrophobia seems to be at least partially possibly as evolutionary mechanism.

Of all the zero-carbon energy sources available, wind is the only one thats truly cost-competitive today: A 2006 report by U.S. Energy Information Administration put the total cost for wind-produced electricity an average of $55.80 per megawatt-hour, compared to $53.10 for coal, $52.50 for natural gas and $59.30 nuclear power. As a result, wind turbines are being deployed rapidly in many parts of the United States and around the world. And because of winds proven record and its immediate and widespread availability, its an energy source thats seen having the potential to grow very rapidly. Wind probably one of the most significant renewable energy sources, simply because the technology is mature, Paul Sclavounos, an professor mechanical engineering and naval architecture. There is no technological risk. Globally, 2 percent electricity now comes and in some places the rate is much higher: Denmark, present world gets more percent of its electricity from wind, and aiming to boost that number to 50 percent. Some experts estimate wind power account for 10 to 20 percent of world electricity generation over the next few Taking a view, a widely cited 2005 study by researchers at Stanford University projected that wind, if fully harnessed worldwide, meet the worlds present energy needs five times over. And 2010 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the States could more than 12 times its current electricity consumption from alone. But impressive as these figures may sound, wind power still has a long way to go before it becomes a significant factor in reducing carbon emissions. The potential is there with abundant wind available for harvesting on land and, especially, over the oceans but harnessing that power efficiently will require enormous investments in manufacturing and installation. So far, installed wind power has the capacity to generate only about 0.2 terawatts (trillions of watts) of energy a number that pales in comparison to an average world demand of terawatts, expected to double by 2050. The World Wind Energy Association now global wind-power capacity of 1.9 terawatts by 2020. thats peak capacity, and in the best the doesnt blow all the time. In fact, the worlds farms operate at an average capacity factor (the percentage of their maximum power that is actually delivered) somewhere between 20 and 40 percent, depending on their location and technology. Some analysts also concerned that widespread deployment wind power, with its inherently swings output, could stress power grids, forcing the repeated startup shutdown of other generators to compensate for winds variability. Many of the best wind-harvesting sites are far from the areas that most need power, significant investment in delivery infrastructure but building wind farms closer to population centers is controversial because many people object to their appearance and their sounds. One potential solution to these problems lies offshore. While many wind installations in Europe have been built within a miles of shore, in shallow water, there is much potential than 20 miles offshore, where winds blow faster and more reliably. Such while still relatively close to consumers, are generally far to be of sight. MITs Sclavounos has been on the of wind turbines for installation far using floating platforms based on technology used in offshore oilrigs. installations along the Eastern of United States could theoretically most of the electricity needed for the eastern half of the country. And a study in California showed that platforms off the coast there could provide more than two-thirds of the states electricity. Such floating platforms will be essential if wind is to become a major contributor to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, engineer Stephen Connors, director of the Analysis Group for Regional Energy (AGREA) at the MIT Energy Initiative. Wind energy is never going to get big if youre limited to shallow, relatively close [offshore] he says. If youre to have a large impact, you really need floating All of the technology needed to install hundreds of floating wind is well established, both from existing near-shore wind farms and offsho",

The United United Kingdom, China, Japan, Taiwan, Ukraine, France, Germany, and Lithuania are the many countries whose citizens have used SOHO to chase comets. Almost all of SOHO's comets are discovered using images from its Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument. LASCO is used to observe the faint, multimillion-degree atmosphere of the sun, called the corona. A disk in the instrument is used to make artificial eclipse, blocking direct light from the sun, so the much fainter corona can be seen. Sun grazing are discovered when they LASCO's field of view as they pass close by the star. \"Building coronagraphs like is still more art than science, because the light we are trying to detect is very faint,\" said Dr. Joe Gurman, U.S. project scientist for SOHO at Goddard. \"Any imperfections the optics or dust in the instrument will scatter the light, making the images too noisy to be useful.

Experts say that changing the focus from being a participant in stressful situation, to being an observer from a distanced perspective can help an individual come to a true understanding their feelings. Researchers call this strategy “self-distancing.” In a new study, college students who believed a lab partner was berating them for not following responded less aggressively showed less anger when they were told to take analyze their feelings from a perspective. “The secret is to not get immersed in your own anger and, instead, a more detached view,” Dominik Mischkowski, lead author of the research performed at State University. “You have to yourself in this stressful situation a fly on the wall would see it.” While other studies have examined the value of self-distancing for calming angry feelings, is the first to show that can work in the heat of the moment, people are most likely to act aggressively, Mischkowski said. The worst thing to do in an anger-inducing situation is people normally do: try to focus their hurt and angry feelings to understand them, said Brad Bushman, Ph.D., co-author of “If you focus too much on how you’re feeling, it backfires,” Bushman said. “It keeps the aggressive thoughts and feelings active in your which makes it more likely that you’ll aggressively.” Study findings are found online in the Journal of Experimental Social and be published in a future To prove the concept, performed to related studies. The first 94 college students who were told were participating in a study about the effects of music on solving, creativity and emotions. students listened to an intense piece of classical music while to solve 14 difficult anagrams (rearranging a group of letters to form a word such as “pandemonium”). They seven to solve each anagram, record their answer and communicate it to the experimenter over an intercom. But the plan of the study was to provoke the students into anger, which the experimenters did using a technique which has been used many in similar studies. The experimenter interrupted the study participants times to ask them to speak louder into the intercom, finally saying “Look, this the third time I have to say this! you follow directions? Speak louder!” After this part the experiment, the participants were told they would be participating in a task examining the effects of music on creativity feelings. were told to go back the anagram task and “see the scene in your mind’s eye.” They were put into three groups, each of which asked view the scene in ways. Some students to adopt a self-immersed (“see situation unfold through your eyes as if it were happening to all over again”) and then their feelings surrounding the event. Others were told to use self-distancing perspective (“move away from the situation to a point where you now watch event unfold from a distance watch the situation unfold as if it happening to the distant all over again”) then analyze their feelings. The third control group not told to view the or analyze their feelings. Each group was told to replay the scene in their minds for 45 seconds. Then the researchers tested the participants for aggressive thoughts angry feelings. Results showed that students who used the perspective had aggressive thoughts and felt less angry both those who used the self-immersed approach and those in the control group. “The self-distancing helped people regulate their angry feelings and reduced their aggressive thoughts,” Mischkowski said. In a second the went and showed that self-distancing can actually make less aggressive when they’ve provoked. In this study, college students were told they going to do an anagram task, similar the one in the previous experiment. But this case, told they were going to be working with an unseen student partner, rather than one of researchers (in reality, it actually was one of the researchers). In this case, the supposed partner was the one who delivered scathing comments about following directions. As in the first study, the participants were then randomly assigned to analyze their feelings surrounding the task from a self-immersed a self-distanced perspective.

European data that the disease incidence has increased five-six-fold children under the age of 15 years after World War II, and there are no signs that the increase in incidence is levelling off. The most conspicuous increase has been seen among age of years. The TRIGR study is the study ever aimed at primary prevention of type 1 diabetes. The study is designed to answer the question whether excluding cow's milk protein from the infant's decreases the risk of fu-ture diabetes. All subjects are followed for years to get information on whether the dietary recommendations for infants at increased genetic of type 1 diabetes should be revised. Starting in 2002, 76 study centres from countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and USA) have been recruiting families for the study. To be eligible the newborn infant has at least one family member (mother, father and/or sib) type 1 diabetes and carry a HLA genotype conferring for type diabetes. The initial recruitment target 2032 eligible was reached at the be-ginning of September 2006, but Study Group has decided to recruitment the end of December 2006 (when the EU contribution will finish) to make the study even more statistically.

The trial has logistically been a true challenge for both the ICC and DMU. DMU has been successful in establishing a secure, real-time, web-based, interactive data system that works extremely well. This can be directly applied to future international mul-ticentre studies. The TRIGR is generating a wealth of information on breast-feeding practices, infant nutrition and growth in young children in various countries. At 2 weeks of age almost all the participating infants were Exclusive continued longer Europe than North America. More than one third of the infants %) received other foods in to breast milk and/or infant formulas at the of 4 months, while WHO recommends that food be introduced at the earliest by the age 6 months. In Europe the first foods to be introduced are typically vegetables and fruits, whereas gluten-free cereals are most commonly introduced in North America. Newborn infants in Northern Europe (NE) had a birth weight but a shorter birth length than infants in Central and Southern Europe (CSE). The NE children remained heavier than from CSE at least up to the age of 18 months. The NE children were also taller than the CSE children starting already from the age of 3 months up to the age of 18 months. Accelerated in infancy has been identified as a risk factor type 1 diabetes later in childhood. Accordingly the growth pattern may contribute to the higher incidence of type in NE compared to CSE.

Financial Times readers, who spend more than that amount on their morning newspaper, are no position to dispute that judgment. In the past two decades, economic growth in China and India has reduced poverty by an unprecedented amount. That achievement not diminished because some individuals in both these countries have very rich. Fundamentally, poverty is about absolute deprivation.Kay observes that there is also a relative definition of poverty: Under the definition that I have proposed on this blog for wealth, poverty would simply be an absence of wealth, a deficit of valued outcomes. The median income is the level that equal of people above and below, so that a rise in Sir Martin bonus does not lead anyone into poverty – that would confuse poverty and inequality.

If we care about obesity, lack of access to antibiotics or even Facebook -- all perfectly legitimate valued -- then let's track these on their merits and based on transparent variables that measure these outcomes.

Carlos Museum a fascinating exhibit based on the papyrus legal of family which lived in Egypt in the 5th Century BC. As a testament to the lasting lessons such archaeological treasures can transmit, it came mind last week when Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to same-sex marriage. The papyri were the legal documents of a couple, a temple official, and his Tamut, an Egyptian woman who’d been sold into slavery a child. They lived on the island of Elephantine in the Nile, in a time when Egypt was part of the Persian Empire and Jewish mercenaries guarded its southern border. As it is today, relationships could be complicated back then. When she married on July 3, 449 BC, Tamut was owned by another man, Meshullam, didn’t free her or her daughter for another 22 years. Things worked though. Later papyri record Ananiah giving Tamut part ownership of their house, selling a to his son-in-law and making payments on a wedding gift for their daughter. The records are a striking of the bizarre with the familiar. The conventions of legalese have changed so little over the millenia that a modern-day lawyer would feel completely at home with these contracts. But the concept marriage around which these legal proceedings revolve appears to have been radically different from ours today. The contract between Ananiah and Tamut is so detailed that it specifies on which side the stairs each is to walk up and But as far as the state was concerned, marriage like theirs – the notarized enumeration what one party the other to for, if things didn’t work out – was all the marriage was. Since Ananiah was a religious leader, there may have been a to sanctify the marriage within the Jewish community on the island, but over the whole of Egyptian society, state’s involvement in defining, protecting preserving marriage was quite limited to each If government has developed better way deal this complex aspect of human society, it was not in evidence when North Carolina voters overwhelmingly declared their support for an amendment defining solely as the union between a man and a woman, and Obama declared the next day that he’d decided his views on the subject and supports the right people of the sex to marry. By comparison with historic stands taken by presidents, carried remarkably little weight. The states decide this issue, and one just had. Obama’s statement morning news show the following day was couched more something which had been forced by Vice President Joe Biden’s unguarded comments on the subject than the embarrassment of a big vote in the state where the Democrats will hold their convention this summer. This sounds progressively more fishy longer you think about it, particularly when you hear how angry the Obama staffers sounded about Biden’s goofiness, according to the reporters who repeated on-the-record what the staffers them off-the-record. Yet symbolically, Obama’s statement was rightly looked on as an historic event. The North Carolina vote, which into the state constitution what was already on the books as state law, was also largely symbolic. And lemme tell you – as Gov. Roy might said after his bitter experience with changing state flag symbolism is the rat poison of good government. Should government get more involved in as those on both sides of the current controversy would or less? At present the states and the government find themselves in a cycle of ineffectiveness. Washington has no power over what states define marriage to be, but because of the Defense of signed by President Clinton, which prohibits same-sex couples from the rights and protections of marriage in more than a thousand federal laws, really doesn’t matter what the do either. Because our modern concept of marriage unlike the Egyptians — involves a certain fusion, long since blurred, between provinces of religion and the state, we appear bound to state by state an issue which in some respects can only settled congregation by congregation. Nor does government the federal or the state level have the ability to stop the steady decline in heterosexual marriage, as attested by a voluminous array of statistics on divorce, unwed mothers and single-parent households. In terms of the work hours it has to invest, government’s biggest with marriage today is administration of breakups and the management of the carnage that often comes with them. Administratively, were much easier for Ananiah and Tamut, which makes it impossible to replicate the arrangements their day. But their preserved family records challenge us to thin",

In the of the planet, everything has a beginning and an end, and in every era, many have become extinct. never at the horrifying rate of recent one that is thousand times greater than previous eras. This summer a thorough study of many years, prestigious University of Exeter in England declared that the earth is undergoing sixth mass extinction (with the 65 years ago, the disappeared). Yet there is a substantial difference between this and the extinctions of the past: For the first time man is responsible.

Slow Food started its work with biodiversity in 1997 and our foot in the door - that the beginning has given us a unique perspective - was food. If biodiversity disappears what will happen to our food? Together with the plants and animals, the plants domesticated by man, breeds selected (for milk or meat) will also disappear. to FAO, 75% of plant varieties have been irreversibly lost. In the USA the is 95%. Today 60% of the world’s food is based on three cereals: rice and corn.

Once we had identified field action, how did we work? We linked diverse worlds that normally didn’t interact: farmers, cooks, veterinarians, In to achieve objectives: – Help small-scale farmers: To save a breed, we didn’t start from genetic selection; to save an apple we didn’t start from a collection of varieties. we began by seeking out the shepherds that bred certain breed, the farmers that still cultivated that apple, we went and to them.

In the region of the Andes, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were first introduced outside the Andes region four centuries ago, and have become an integral part of much of the world’s cuisine. It is the world’s fourth-largest food crop, rice, wheat, and maize. Long-term storage of potatoes requires specialised care in cold warehouses. Wild potato species occur throughout the Americas, from the United States to Uruguay. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the southern Peru (from a in the Solanum complex), where they were domesticated 7,000–10,000 ago. Following centuries of selective breeding, are now over a thousand different types of Of these subspecies, a variety that at one grew in theChiloé Archipelago (the potato’s south-central Chilean sub-center of origin) left its germplasm on over 99% the cultivated potatoes worldwide. Following Spanish conquest of the the Spanish introduced the potato Europe the second half the 16th century. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow be distrustful European farmers, soon enough it became an food staple and field crop that played a major role in the 19th century population However, lack of genetic due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phytophthora infestans, spread rapidly through the poorer of western Ireland, resulting in the crop failures that led to Irish Famine.

The Spanish Royal Academy says the Spanish word a of the Taino batata (sweet potato) and the Quechua papa (potato). The potato originally referred to a type sweet potato rather than the other around, although there no close relationship between the plants. The English the two plants one for the other. In many of the chronicles detailing agriculture and plants, distinction is the two. The 16th-century English herbalist John Gerard used the terms “bastard potatoes” and “Virginia potatoes” for this species, and referred to sweet as potatoes”. Potatoes are occasionally referred to as “Irish potatoes” or “white potatoes” in the United States, to distinguish them from potatoes. The name spud for a potato comes from the of soil (or a hole) prior to the planting of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. 1440) used a term a short knife or dagger, probably related to Dutch spyd and/or the Latin “spad-” root “sword”; cf. Spanish “espada”, English “spade” and “spadroon”. The word spud traces back to the 16th century. It subsequently transferred over to a variety digging tools. Around 1845 it transferred over to the tuber itself.

But heat and heat-related are not synonymous. In fact, in several refereed papers published in recent years, my Virginia colleague Robert Davis and I demonstrated that heat-related deaths have, in aggregate, declined significantly as our cities have warmed. In fact, in a statistical sense, we have completely engineered heat-related mortality out of several of our urban cores, particularly in cities like Philadelphia. Considering every decade of mortality data at once is misleading; examining it decade-by-decade is more informative. When looked the data reveals a remarkable adaptation: as cities have warmed, the “threshold” temperatures at which mortality to increase have also risen — more than temperatures of the cities. For example, in Philadelphia in the 1960s, mortality began to increase once the high temperature exceeded 83 degrees. In the 1970s, the mortality threshold rose to the low 90s. In the last decade, there has been little evidence for any threshold at mortality increases. In other words, people adapted to their changing climate. How?

This summer’s heat is a bit unusual. Usually, when it’s very hot in the eastern temperatures are normal or below average in the West, or vice-versa. This year it’s hot everywhere.

Nineteen-thirty was a in rural far from Washington’s sprawl, people suffered a total of 21 triple-digit days. Even with the excess heat contributed by the growth of the city, Washington currently averages only one 100 degree per year. The fact is that we cannot completely discriminate between repetitive and prospective warming when it comes to a single summer. The better to for warming is in the winter. Greenhouse-effect theory predicts that the coldest of winter will rise much more sharply than the hottest ones of summer. indeed, for the last decades, winter’s lows have warmed out of proportion to summer’s highs. All of which illustrates the complexity of global warming. Would accept — even welcome? climate change that greatly winter discomfort at the cost of slightly higher summer temperatures? Clearly, people adapted to the heat. The shows that, the warmer the city, the more quickly its residents adapt. Heat-related deaths are increasing in only major city: chilly Seattle. San Francisco and Los Angeles, two other cities that are relatively cool in the summer compared those to their east, show no change in As the UN’s climatologists should heat are dangerous when they are rare and unexpected, because people are unfamiliar with them and slow to appropriate actions to minimize their exposure.

Carbon makes up somewhere from 0.7% to 3.2% of the earth’s elements. We know that there is carbon trapped under the earth’s but we don’t know how much. The Deep Carbon Observatory is going to study much carbon there is in the earth and what happens it. Another question is form is the... Friday, February 25, 2011 Where does gas come from? Carbon!

In both systems, people had to lie to bureaucratic or to about their interests, their skills or circumstances. who has died at the of 90, founded the field of design”, a new way of which focused on giving people incentives to tell the truth to so in a way that would benefit society as a whole. His mechanism design idea has applications in a range of practical areas, from the design of computer networks and voting systems to arbitration rules. The debate between state planning and free markets must have seemed far from academic to Hurwicz. His parents were Polish Jews who fled the Kaiser’s army, going to Moscow, where Hurwicz was born in 1917. returned to Poland in a horse-drawn wagon escape the Bolsheviks when he was went to the University of Warsaw and took a degree in law, though he also studied piano at the conservatory. Throughout his Hurwicz was a renaissance man interests included music, linguistics, maths, and meteorology. Yet as a student his interest was kindled in economics. He went to London to study and then, via Geneva, to the where he arrived in 1940. His parents and his brother joined him but only after fleeing another invading German army – time the Nazis – then spending time in Soviet labour camps. On his had under both Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, who was at the London School as Hurwicz began his PhD studies there in 1938. Von Mises and Hayek argued that a centrally planned economy was doomed to collapse: because every individual knew his own needs and capabilities best, government planners could never hope to piece it all together make sensible decisions. Other economists, such as Oskar Lange, disagreed. A burgeoning of markets, and bitter experience of the failings of socialist economies, led many conclude that von Mises and Hayek right. Hurwicz was more interested in advancing the debate declaring “Panaceas are to be found at either end the spectrum,” he wrote in 1984. with Hayek and von Mises that a bureaucrat who simply demanded results would be met with budgetpadding and lies. But rather than giving up, Hurwicz the problem directly. He asked what “mechanisms” an intelligent but ill-informed planner might use to information from others and then allocate resources efficiently or profitably. Such mechanisms are as old as trade itself, most the auction, in even ignorant seller can expect a good price. But Hurwicz laid the foundations for thinking systematically designing mechanisms, defining all the terms rigorously showing what might be possible. Hurwicz described a a kind of “message centre”, market participants would submit information, or false, a pre-specified set of rules would adjudicate the result. That abstract description is a perfect account of Ebay auction: a seller sets a minimum bid, a time limit and perhaps a reserve price, while bidders submit bids that may bear no resemblance the true value they place on the prize. EBay is just one example of a message centre; Hurwicz showed that was useful to think about many economic institutions in this way. Participants in a mechanism can always lie. A keen buyer can pretend to be an indifferent one; a brilliant worker can conceal his laziness. Hurwicz realised that in order to get better bid from the keenest buyer, for example, the seller must give that buyer a reason to tell the truth. Similarly, an employer cannot persuade the ablest worker to work just as hard as the rest unless the extra effort brings extra general problem of persuading the “best” agents to act from the rest is called the “incentive compatibility constraint”. One example would be auction where highest bidder wins but only has to pay the second highest bid. This strange-sounding rule is all it takes to persuade the keenest bidder to the about the real value he places on the prize. EBay uses a rule. Although studied with the of the field – including Kaldor at the LSE, and Paul Samuelson – he never had an economics degree. “Whatever economics learned, I learned by and learning,” he said, after winning Nobel prize.

Some of the uninhabited islands, as the Isla de Ratones just off the shore of Rico, are available for day trips and reached by ferries, boats or kayaks. The islands of the Caribbean have enough land space to support rivers. Hispaniola has four primary rivers: del Norte, Yuna River, Yaque del Sur the Artibonite River. Cuba's important rivers are the Rio Cauto, which is the longest, Almendares and Rio Yurimi. Smaller rivers contribute these three main rivers. The Grande de Arecibo Puerto Rico's longest river. This river, along several others as the Cibuco, Loiza and La Plata, run north. One river runs westward: the Grande de Añasco. The Bahamas no rivers. Many of the Caribbean islands have mountainous areas. Most of Puerto Rico's mountains are located on island's interior. Jamaica has mountains that cover almost all of its surface.

The summary the lecture republished here with the author’s consent. THE ABUSE OF HOLOCAUST MEMORY Summary Lecture in Helsinki November 2012 By Manfred Gerstenfeld The Holocaust has become a symbol of absolute evil in Western society. This happened gradually over the It not the case in say, 1960. Yet one might have expected that with the Second World War more than years behind us, mention memory of it would fade away. Indeed, there is in many circles what is termed “Holocaust fatigue.” people do not want to hear anything anymore about the Holocaust. At the same time, many others increasingly mention and discuss the It took 60 years until in 2005 Nations General named 27 January as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. On this day, every member state of the UN has an official obligation to honor the victims of the Nazi era and develop material about Holocaust. This year the remembrance of the Holocaust is devoted to children.1 Why this Interest in the Holocaust? What are the main reasons for this increasing interest the Holocaust? We can identify some but do not know their relative weight. Memorial celebrations take place every year in many places. There are also new monuments still going up and new memorial being inaugurated. One was at Drancy the major transit camp in France. 63,000 of the 76,000 deported Jews transited before almost all of them to deaths. Yet both memorial days pass and monuments disappear from the public eye most of the time. New historical research is being published about the Holocaust. Additional documents are also discovered. One example among many was that in October 2012, pictures taken by Hitler’s photographer Hugo Jaeger, of Polish Jews in the ghetto of Kutno between 1939 were released. This was done to mark the official establishment the Warsaw Ghetto in October 1940.2 Such research and discoveries are mentioned in media. Thus they also a role in the increased interest. The increasing central place the Holocaust European societies is also due a number of other developments. One is that European have increasingly secular, which means that their common norms values have to a large extent broken In such ideological and moral vacuum, one out standards many people more less agree upon. The partly fills that function. plays a role as a defining moment in European history. The Holocaust touches upon very basic questions which many Europeans do not like to ask themselves explicitly. What was it in European culture and in European societies that the Holocaust possible? This leads to a taboo question. Have the elements which made the possible disappeared, or are to some extent still with us? The first nations which should ask these questions are Germany Austria. Yet present they do not seem inclined to do so. The generation is not responsible for what ancestors did. However, the Holocaust and Nazism can not eliminated from German history. I would like to phrase question somewhat differently. of the ancestors of contemporary Germans Austrians were Nazi enthusiasts. Many other Germans and Austrians went along with Nazis without hesitation. Is it at all that nothing of these has remained in these countries today? Another element of importance for the interest in the Holocaust the growing uncertainty in the world. That requires more and more of reference for events take place daily. One example which has to be analyzed is the emergence of parties in European countries with many neo-fascist and neo-Nazi characteristics. This becomes problematic in particular if these enter Parliament. While the interest in the Holocaust growing there is simultaneously also a massive increase in the distortion of the and the memory of the Holocaust. To understand the abuse of the Holocaust in our days, have start at it by category. In my book, “The Abuse of Holocaust Memory, Distortions and Responses” I have developed eight categories of distortion. These are: Holocaust Justification and Promotion, Holocaust Denial, Holocaust Deflection and Whitewashing, Holocaust Equivalence,Holocaust Inversion, i.e the Portraying Israel and Jews as Holocaust Trivialization and Obliterating Holocaust Memory The massive ongoing of Holocaust brings us the question, what can be done about it? There is no single fight against the abuse the Holocaust. Education is very important. So are memorials, monuments etc. The crucial point however remains not to let abuse of the Holocaust enter further in the public debate. It is",

This meaning can distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below. The introduction \"cause-and-effect\" introduces complications related to what meant by a 'cause' and how presence of a might established, of which varies from one physical theory to another. These complications are avoided by a more general formulation based upon connections between 'events' by a theory: \"a theory is deterministic if, and if, given state variables for some initial period, the theory logically determines a unique set of values for variables for any other period.\" —Ernest Nagel, Alternative descriptions of physical state p. 292 This quote replaces the idea of 'cause-and-effect' with of 'logical implication' according to one or another theory connects events. addition, an 'event' related by to formalized described using the parameters defined by that theory.

They include debates concerning determinism and free will, denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with self-determination of human reasons, motives, desires.

One class of CSG problems occur when surfaces of being operated upon coincide. For example, when subtracting box from another box to make a square cup, the result will be wrong if the tops of two boxes coincide. To correct this, the inner box should be made slightly taller than the outer box. A problem that must be avoided occurs when two coincident surfaces are assigned different surface properties.

The resilience of bdelloid and their sex-free lifestyle has scientists.

It appears they overcome this hurdle by stealing DNA from our organisms. \"Our result shows that genes can enter the of bdelloids in a manner fundamentally different from that which, in other animals, results from the mating of males and females,\" says \"We found many genes that appear to have originated in bacteria, fungi, and plants.\" The waterborne creatures, which range in size from 0.1 to 1 millimetres lay but all their offspring are female. believe that when bdelloids dry out, fracture their genetic material rupture cellular membranes. When they they rebuild their genomes and membranes, incorporating of genetic material from other bdelloids and unrelated species in their vicinity. \"These fascinating animals not only relaxed the barriers to incorporation of material, but, more surprisingly, they managed to keep some of these alien genes functional,\" report co-author Dr Irina Arkhipova says. According to the researchers, the next step is to determine whether bdelloid genomes also contain homologous genes imported from other bdelloids. Meselson and his colleagues also hope to examine whether the animals actually use any of the hundreds of snippets of foreign DNA they appear to vacuum up. Understanding the animals acquire and make use of these new genes could have implications for medicine. Genetic mutations, which occur constantly in any living underlie cancer, heart and various other diseases.",

If there were to be a unifying theme in Italian cooking, it would have be the utilization of fresh, seasonal However, to the diversity of climate and geography in Italy, even the available ingredients themselves are different from area to area. A good example the regionalism of styles and ingredients can be found in the differences between northern and southern Italian cooking. Much of southern diet is influenced by its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in reliance on fresh fish such as swordfish. In addition, its abundance seafood has caused the cooking style to be lighter and simpler, highlighting ingredients such as tomatoes and olive oil. This style has even been deemed by the Italian government as the “Mediterranean Cuisine”. The northern style however, the southern reliance on fish with beef, pork, and dried beans which are more in the region. In the north uses butter cream rather olive oil as it’s dominating cooking fat. The is a tradition that is heavier and heartier than the provinces. It is worth mentioning that many of the new trends in Italian cuisine seen in America are of this approach. Risotto, a savory rice dish which relies on the breakdown of produce characteristic creaminess, and polenta, a side dish made from corn meal, have long been mainstays of the northern Italian diet. Despite the popularity of these broader dishes to this country’s restaurant scene, most Americans still associate Italian with pasta and pizza. And while pasta does play an important role in cuisine, it is much more versatile than spaghetti and meatballs. Orzo, for example, is rice-shaped pasta that is seen often prepared as a side dish to beef or veal while gnocchi are potato dumplings often seen tossed in simple sauces highlight their delicateness. Even heartier pastas are often paired with more than just marinara sauce. Examples of this are the northern-used Bolognese sauce, a meaty blend of tomatoes and cream, and the dramatically different pesto, a light chopped basil, garlic, olive oil, and pine nuts. Finally, desserts play an important part of the Italian diet. Cannolis and tiramisu, both of which contain sweetened fillings, are the widely known in America though others have recently gained attention. For gelatos are similar to ice but differ in that they are served in a semi-frozen state which results in a creamier, smoother texture. For health-conscious, a granita might be preferred. Because of absence of milk or cream, the final texture coarser and more crystalline. On the other end of the dessert spectrum are those made wine or alcohol.

Prof. Margalit Tel Aviv University's Department of Classics has created an illuminating tool, the world's first Homer Encyclopedia. in three volumes by Wiley-Blackwell last year and more recently in electronic form, the encyclopedia is an invaluable window into Homer's life the characters and settings his work from primary characters to the village mentioned in passing. The volumes also examine the pre-history of Homer and the in which he lived and wrote, and how the text has been received and transmitted by various cultures and societies throughout history to the present day. One of its groundbreaking areas of research is the reception of Homer in the Jewish and Arabic traditions, a subject that has rarely explored. With contributions from 132 scholars worldwide, this three work is a exploration of all things Homer. \"Through this encyclopedia, you can enter Homer's world and get lost in it,\" says Prof. Finkelberg, who was awarded the Rothschild Prize in the Humanities. \"It is for its comprehensive view — the entire field is as vibrant, alive and contemporary. Homer's work is put a modern living context, rather approached impenetrable classic monument.\" avatar of Greek One section of the encyclopedia examines \"textual reception\" over 2,000 years of history. Its purpose is to examine how Homeric texts were received from the view of cultures, e.g. Victorian England. Studying history of the of a major text is an emerging field of study, Prof. Finkelberg explains — profoundly important to the progress the humanities. One the most original of this work is an in-depth study of Homer in the context of Jewish and Arabic conducted by leading Homer's work is foundational to the tradition, it has never been central to these Eastern traditions, which put more of an emphasis on \"useful\" such regarding science, medicine, and philosophy. The findings, she are surprising. Because the Hellenic world is little-known in these cultures, Homer is seen as a symbol of Greek culture its entirety. \"Poetry was not translated in these cultures, and because of this, very little was known about the art of the Greeks beyond philosophers like Aristotle. For them, Homer represented everything to do with Greek culture, including paganism,\" explains Prof. Finkelberg. Anything \"Greek\" was essentially \"Homeric\" and vice versa. Prof. Finkelberg believes that the publication is a crucial addition to encyclopedias the work poets such as Dante Virgil. After all, Homer is not just any writer. In the absence of the sacred religious texts that are to other traditions, such as the Bible to Judeo-Christian the Iliad and the Odyssey are the formative of Greek culture. Because of this, the fields of Homeric archaeology and Biblical archaeology rest the same historical axis, suggests Prof. Finkelberg. Homer's use of history reflects real historical events and has inspired archaeological was through Homer, for example, that German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann was to search the ruins of Troy, the site of the Trojan War in Homer's works. the city was believed to be a mere literary invention. Though Homer cannot used as a historical text in the modern Prof. Finkelberg says that his literary works are themselves not unlike an archaeological site, where different of history can be pieced together to reveal intriguing tale of a world long past.

The resulting reorganization restructured the Army into three major commands: the Army Ground Forces (AGF), the Army Air Forces (AAF), a command initially called the Services of Supply (SOS)—the Army’s sustainment command. Everything that did not fit clearly into the AGF or the went to the SOS. General Brehon B.

As recorded in the Army’s official history of the organization, the ASF was without “direct precedent” unusual “in the variety of tasks entrusted to it. . . . [I]t was a hodgepodge of agencies with many and varied functions.” From the beginning until it was disestablished in 1946, “the ASF struggled constantly to build a unity of purpose and organization.” Lieutenant General Somervell, a career admitted never liking the part of the reorganization that gave him responsibility for personnel. He gave most of his attention to the monumental task of procurement and supply.

The CDC established two combat development “integrating agencies” modeled after the mission and functions of the and ASF of World War One agency integrated the development of and combat support functions, and the other, the Combat Service Support acted as integrator for what we would call the sustainment function.

The person may start to find difficult to find familiar fail to observe road signs and respect of the road, too fast or too have slow reactions and become confused, frustrated or angry while driving. people with dementia are often extremely reluctant to give up the right to drive, as it is one of the last of their independence and adulthood. It can therefore be difficult to convince them of the necessity to stop driving. it is too dangerous an not to be dealt with straight should first try to discuss the issue driving with the person with pointing the possible dangers of driving, as well the benefits of not having to. They may feel angry and depressed the loss and need support during this awkward period. It soften the blow if you were to arrange for other forms of transport or other to drive the person around. However, persuasion does not work and some carers have tremendous difficulties trying to stop the person with dementia from driving. If is the might find that the person is more willing to to a doctor, the or someone in authority. If is also unsuccessful, you may have to try to them from driving. You could, for example, hide car keys, arrange for the car to work (e.g. by the cap) or park the car down the out of If it is not needed, you could even sell the car and the money saved would help pay for other means transport. One carer overcame this problem by leaving the car out ready to drive without the ignition key. Her husband in it and happily “drove” for hours changing gears and signalling without actually moving. Whatever you decide to do, you should inform the insurance company about the diagnosis of dementia. Care should be not to let the person with dementia smoke as it is fire hazard. Also, some people with dementia might forget that they are holding a cigarette and it could burn their fingers. should try to persuade person to cut down on and preferably stop. People with dementia often forget smoke and don’t miss cigarettes once the has been broken. However, they continue smoking, there are a few useful precautions to take, e.g. put large ashtrays everywhere, replace baskets with metal bins, buy flame resistant clothes and furniture, fit smoke alarms and keep matches out of reach. Smoking alone, in bed, is the biggest risk. You might have more success persuading the person with dementia to restrict their smoking to times when there is company, rather than trying to prevent it altogether. It is important to pay particular attention not to let the person smoke if are using nicotine patches as this greatly increases health risks. Alcoholic drinks may increase confusion in the person with Although the occasional social drink should not cause particular concern, it is best to ask your doctor’s advice about whether the person with dementia should have to alcoholic This is particularly important if they are under medication. Even if the doctor agrees to the person having an occasional drink, you will still need to make sure that they do not have more. Loss of memory result in the person with that they have already had a drinks. It best to keep in a locked hidden away. Early on in the the person with dementia be to use public transport. But as the progresses they may start to have difficulties remembering where they are going, paying fare, getting the right bus or train, getting out at the right place, etc. When happen",

However, this is not sufficient to demand and it is estimated only about 1% the elderly receive home care services provided by the government. The main aim of social services network to keep people in their homes for as long possible. The vast majority of elderly dependent people have to rely on services provided by informal carers. Care of elderly and dependent tends to be seen as a family obligation. However, according to a survey carried out in 2001, only 24% of the population believe that will continue bear the responsibility for caring for their elderly parents in future and the number of elderly alone is steadily increasing (Larizgoitia Jauregi, 2004) Legislation relating to the provision of home services The constitution states all citizens are entitled to “health protection”. The General Health 1986, the creation of National Health System, that access health services is citizen’s right. In the Spanish Civil Code (Book 1), it is stated that the spouse and children of elderly dependent people are responsible for maintenance and care which covers everything that is essential for sustenance, shelter, clothing and medical assistance. The extent of maintenance to provided depends the means of the providers and the needs the dependent person. The obligation to provide maintenance comes to an end when the dies or when their wealth has fallen to such continuing to do so would mean having to neglect their own needs or those of their family. Brothers and sisters also have an obligation to provide maintenance but they come after spouses and descendants, but obligation what is absolutely necessary Kerschen et al., 2005). Citizens’ do not have a legally established to social services. The provision such services is at the discretion of the Autonomous Administration. Access rights governed by legislation at the level of the autonomous communities. The main criterion of the social service network is to keep the in their own environment for as long as possible. The social are therefore aimed maintenance in the There is also a residential type network. These services generally concentrate on attending dependent elderly who live alone. The need is also recognised to help with few resources. Organisation and financing of home care services Health care services are by the autonomous communities. Each has Health Service and draws up a Health Plan which outlines which activities are necessary in order meet the objectives of its own Health Service. other services by the services the autonomous communities, there is primary care which includes health care in the home and care specifically for elderly. Home care services are free for people who are the minimum pension. People have an income twice as high as the minimum pension must pay for the services whereas those on an intermediary income must pay a certain amount which is calculated on the basis their income. Health care is funded exclusively through general taxation and not through social security contributions. Home social services are financed jointly by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the regional ministries Welfare and the municipalities. Home by practitioners and primary care nurses funded through the Public Health Service. In addition to government provided services, voluntary associations and not-for-profit such as the Red Cross also social home care (Carrillo, 2005). Kinds of home care services available Home care include primary care social services, work, assistance with tasks, meals-on-wheels and services. However, these services are not available in the practice, home care services are more or less limited to household tasks (which also includes laundry and shopping). This seems to be based on the choice of the elderly people many of whom think that personal care should be carried out by the family. This seems to shared by carers who often prefer to receive formal assistance with household tasks rather than personal care (Valderrama et al., 1997 in Larizgoitia Jauregi, 2004).

The Civil War and the Depression, though distant time, remain more recent and raw in our collective memory than the American founding, so we find it easier to appreciate achievements of Lincoln and Roosevelt. achievement must be recovered before it can be appreciated, which means that we must recognize that there was no such thing as a viable American nation he took office as President, that the opening words of the Constitution (“We the of the United States”) expressed but fragile hope rather than a social reality. The roughly four settlers spread along the coastline and streaming over the Alleghenies felt primary allegiance—to the extent felt any allegiance —to local, state, and regional authorities. No government ever before exercised control over a population this or land this large, and the prevailing assumption among best-informed European observers was that, to paraphrase Lincoln’s formulation, nation so conceived and so dedicated could endure. Not much happened at the Executive level during the first year of Washington’s Presidency, which was exactly the way he wanted His official correspondence was dominated by applications from veterans of the war, former and total strangers. They all received the same republican response—namely, that merit than favoritism determine federal As for the President himself, it was not clear whether he the helm or merely occupying the bridge. Rumors began to that regarded his role as primarily ceremonial and symbolic, that after a mere two years he intended to step down, having launched the American ship of contributed his prestige as ballast on its voyage. As it turned even ceremonial occasions troubling questions because no one knew how the symbolic centerpiece of a republic should behave or what to call him. Vice President John Adams, trying to helpful, ignited a fiery debate in the Senate by suggesting such regal titles as Elective Majesty” “His Mightiness,” which provoked a lethal combination of shock and laughter, well observation that Adams himself should be called “His Rotundity.” Eventually Senate resolved on the most innocuous The President of the United States should be called exactly that. Matters social etiquette—how the President should interact with the public, where he should be accessible and where insulated—prompted multiple memorandums on the what Alexander Hamilton called “a pretty high tone” that stopped short of secluding the President entirely. The solution was a weekly open called the levee, part imperial court ceremony with choreographed bows and part drop-in parlor social. The levee struck the proper middle between courtly formality and republican simplicity, though at expense of becoming a notoriously boring and wholly scripted occasion. The very awkwardness of the levee fitted Washington’s temperament nicely since he a preternatural ability to remain silent while everyone around him was squirming under pressure to fill that silence with conversation. (Adams later claimed “gift of silence” was Washington’s greatest political asset, which Adams deeply envied because lacked it The formal of the levee and Washington’s natural dignity (or was it aloofness?) combined to create a political atmosphere unimaginable in any modern-day national capital. In a year when the French broke in violent spasms destined to reshape the entire political landscape of Europe, the new Congress ratified a Bill of Rights that codified the sweeping guarantee of freedoms ever enacted, no one at the levees to comment on those events. Even matters of etiquette and however, could have constitutional consequences, Washington in August of 1789. The treaty-making power of the President required that he seek “the Advice and Consent of the Senate.” Washington interpreted phrase to require his personal appearance in the Senate and solicitation of senatorial opinion on specific treaty provisions in mode of a large advisory council.

And, most importantly, lose their chemical utility—their ability seemingly compounds to each other, their inspiring new experiments. I'm thinking concepts such as the chemical bond, a functional group and the logic substitution, aromaticity, steric acidity and basicity, electronegativity and oxidation-reduction. As well as some ideas I've been involved in personally—through-bond coupling, orbital symmetry control, the isolobal analogy. Consider the notion of oxidation state. If you had choose two words to epitomize the nature of chemistry, you not pick ferrous and ferric? The concept evolved at the end of the 19th century (not without confusion \"valency\"), when the reality of ions in solution was established. As did a multiplicity of notations—ferrous iron iron in an oxidation state of +2 (or is it 2+?) or Fe(II). for assigning oxidation states (sometimes called oxidation numbers) adorn every introductory chemistry text. They begin with the indisputable: In compounds, the oxidation states of the most electronegative elements hold on most to their valence electrons), oxygen and fluorine for example, are –2 and –1, respectively. After that the rules grow ornate, desperately struggling to wide applicability with simplicity. The oxidation-state scheme had tremendous classificatory power (for compounds, not organic ones) from the beginning. Think of the sky blue color of chromium(II) versus the violet or green of chromium(III) salts, four distinctly colored oxidation states of vanadium. Oliver Sacks writes beautifully of the attraction of these colors for a boy starting in chemistry. not only boys. But there was more to oxidation states than just describing color. Or balancing equations. Chemistry is transformation. The utility of states dovetailed with logic oxidizing and reducing agents—molecules and ions that ease removed or added electrons to other Between electron transfer and proton transfer you have much of reaction I want to tell you this logic leads to quite incredible compounds, but first let's look for trouble. Not for molecules—only for the human beings thinking about them. Those Charges are Real, Aren't They? Iron is not only or ferric, but also comes in oxidation states ranging from +6 (in BaFeO4) to (in Fe(CO)42–, a good organometallic reagent). there really a charge of +6 on the iron in the first compound and –2 charge the carbonylate? Of course not, as Linus Pauling told us in one of his many correct (among some intuitions. Such large charge separation in molecule is unnatural. Those iron ions aren't bare—the metal center is surrounded by more or less tightly \"ligands\" other simple ions (Cl– for instance) or molecular groupings PH3, CO). The ligands act as sources sinks of electrons, partly neutralizing the formal charge of the central metal atom. At the end, the net on a metal ion, regardless of its oxidation state, rarely lies outside the of +1 to –1. Actually, my should have been countered critically another: How do you define the charge on an atom? problem indeed. A Socratic dialogue on the concept us to the unreality of dividing up electrons so they are assigned to atoms and not to bonds. A kind of tortured pushing of quantum mechanical, delocalized reality into a localized, electrostatic frame. In the course of that discussion it would become clear that the idea of a charge on an atom a theoretical one, that it definition of regions of space and algorithms for divvying electron density. And that discussion devolve, no doubt acrimoniously, into a fight over the merits uniquely defined but arbitrary protocols for that density. People in the will I'm talking about population analysis\" or \"natural bond analysis\" or Richard Bader's beautifully worked out for dividing up in a molecule. What about Is there an observable that might a charge on an atom? think photoelectron spectroscopies (ESCA or Auger) come the closest. one measures the energy necessary to an inner-core to a higher level or to ionize it. Atoms in different states do tend to group themselves at certain energies. the theoretical framework that relates these spectra to charges depends on the same assumptions that bedevil the definition of charge on an atom. An state bears little relation to the actual charge on the atom in the interior of the sun, where ligands gone,",

MRI Side Effects Patients occasionally experience minor side effects after an MRI scan. |Magnetophosphenes (brief flashes of light across the retina)||Vertigo/Dizziness||Metallic taste in the mouth||Nausea||Physical burns or burning sensations (extremely rare)| MRIs do place patients at risk for radiation-induced damage. Because MRIs do use ionizing radiation, prefer MRIs for patients who need routine imaging scans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concludes that as long as the strengths are kept below 2.0 Tesla, MRIs are safe for repeated use. MRIs for Mesothelioma Tumors Magnetic resonance imaging plays a limited role in diagnosing mesothelioma. When doctors do MRI scans to diagnose the disease, they often them to CT scan results. MRI-generated images can help differentiate between normal tissue and tumor tissue, which cannot be determined with a CT scan alone. MRI scans produce a visual representation of differences is signal intensity between cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Because cancerous tissues emit more intense signals than healthy tissue, malignant mesothelioma tissues appear as white spots on the results with varying brightness. The difference between malignant and noncancerous tissue is even more pronounced in contrast-enhanced MRIs. To arrive at a mesothelioma radiologists usually inspect MRI-generated images fo",

In a recent in the Journal of Lipid Research, researchers from Oregon State University set to assess the data we have to answer that question. The review article by Donald Jump, Christopher M. Depner and Sasmita Tripathy was part of a thematic series geared toward identifying new lipid and lipoprotein targets for the of cardiometabolic Interest in the health benefits omega-3 PUFA stemmed from epidemiological studies on Greenland Inuits in the 1970s that linked reduced rates of myocardial infarction (compared with rates among Western populations) to a high dietary intake of fish-derived omega-3 PUFA. Those studies have spurred hundreds of others attempting to unravel the effects of omega-3 PUFA on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. |The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) conversion Omega-3 in diet Fish-derived sources of omega-3 PUFA are eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These fatty acids can be found in and foods such as salmon, anchovies and sardines. Plant-derived sources of omega-3 PUFA are alpha-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid. Alpha-linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid. It cannot be synthesized in the body, it is necessary to get it from dietary sources, such as flaxseed, walnuts, canola and chia seeds. The overall levels of fatty acids in the heart and blood are dependent on the metabolism of alpha-linolenic in addition to other dietary sources. The heart of the matter A study in 2007 established that supplementation of alpha-linolenic had no effect myocardial levels of eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid, and it did not significantly increase their content cardiac muscle (3). Furthermore, alpha-linolenic acid intake had association with the of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial or sudden cardiac death (4, 5, 6). In general, it did not significantly the omega-3 index, an indicator of cardioprotection (3). Why doesn’t supplementation of ALA affect the levels of acids downstream in the biochemical pathway (see figure)? The data to to the poor conversion of precursor ALA to DHA, the end product of omega-3 PUFA DHA is assimilated into cellular membrane phospholipids is also to fatty acids that affect several signaling mechanisms that control cardiac and vascular function. According to Jump, “One of the issues ALA that it get processed very well to DHA.” This a metabolic problem involves the initial desaturation step pathway, which is catalyzed by the fatty acid desaturase FADS2. Investigators have explored ways to overcome the metabolic bottleneck created by this rate-limiting step. One approach involves increasing stearidonic acid the diet, Jump says, because FADS2 converts ALA SDA. While studies have shown increasing SDA results in significantly levels of EPA DPA in blood levels of DHA were not increased (7). FADS2 is required for synthesis at the other end of the where it helps produce a DHA precursor. Consumption of EPA DHA from fish-derived oil has been reported to increase atrial and ventricular EPA and DHA in membrane phospholipids and heart disease patients who consumed and DHA supplements had a reduction in coronary artery disease and sudden cardiac death (8). “Based the prospective cohort studies and the clinical studies,” Jump says, “ALA is not viewed as cardioprotective.” He continues, “It generally that EPA DHA confer Consumption of EPA and DHA are recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The question then up from metabolic perspective: Can these other sources of omega-3 PUFA, ALA, be converted to DHA? Yes, they can, but they’re not as effective as taking an EPA- or DHA-containing supplement eating fish containing EPA DHA.” sources of EPA from and DHA algae commercially It’s important to note that omega-3 PUFAs are involved in variety of processes, including cognitive visual acuity and cancer prevention. The molecular and biochemical bases for their effects on those systems are complex and well understood. “These are very busy molecules; they do lot,” Jump says. regulate many pathways, and that is a problem in trying to out the diverse actions these fatty acids have on cells. Even the area of heart function is not fully resolved. While there is a reasonable of the impact of these fatty acids on inflammation, how omega-3 acids control cardiomyocyte contraction",

How may SLPs facilitate modifications within justice system that allow an appropriate amount of time for persons physical challenges to respond to a rapid series of questions from attorneys or police? At access to justice for persons with severe expressive disorders is difficult. The Legal Arena Suppose that an SLP is invited to serve as an expert witness in a case involving a PWCCN. The SLP will work with police, lawyers, and judges connection with a client. It will be necessary to establish an assessment tool that describes the capacity of the client to in court. an expert witness, the SLP will be challenged immediately by opposing counsel regarding the SLP's as an expert as well as his or her choice of assessment SLPs also need to understand the key differences between the clinical and legal arenas. The justice system is centered on \"winning\" and \"losing.\" Insurance companies in determining when settle and \"walk away\" and end the case. Another difference is the process of evaluation of the client's communication skills. For example, sometimes a proposal for an evaluation must first be submitted the court and both attorneys for approval before any contact with individual is permitted. Thus, the SLP may prepare by reading hundreds of pages of clinical and educational reports regarding individual with an expressive communication disability, and may then need to seek approval for each proposed diagnostic strategy before the actual evaluation. Modifications to the plan may be suggested by either attorney or the judge. Experts in litigation today be familiar with origin and significance of Daubert case (Bernstein Hartsell, 2005). This 1993 landmark decision (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms. , 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed.2d 469) resulted in specific instructions for expert into the courtroom. Basically, rule established requirements for admissibility of expert testimony, including whether or the employed technique has been peer-reviewed and published, has a known error rate, can be tested, and a generally accepted practice within the field. As expert witnesses, to for testimony the understanding scientific knowledge will be tested by the opposing attorney, challenged regarding peer reviews and publications, and examined for errors and general acceptance by their own scholarly community. and comma in their reports will scrutinized. Although SLPs may feel confident in professional knowledge base and clinical skills in AAC, writing and defending the expert report within the legal system is very preparing a clinical report for a public or medical facility. To prepare a report for testimony, SLPs need to translate their clinical knowledge into a legally useful form without using and to follow the rules, roles, and procedures for written according to legal tradition. These evaluations and reports be precise so as not introduce any reasonable doubt. Failure to understand the and use of a written report may result in a damaging cross-examination undermine the credibility. One difficulty is establishing a legal capacity for expressive communication when that expression is an alternative form speech. As yet, there is no legal definition of \"capacity\" testimony if not through speech. The definition of \"capacity\" is important—a client must be judged to have the \"capacity\" to participate, because a legal case may set a precedent. When assistive technologies, such as speech-generating (SGDs) or voice output aids (VOCAs), are introduced, the question arises: Does the legal capacity (or definition of expressive communication competence) shift when an is used?

I spoke with half the team to find out (because talking to all of them would've made this post longer than a Sea scroll). Lauren studies an order of crustaceans, was picking samples from dive sites (and one nightlighting session) with small (usually less then 10mm) creatures in mind. She uses the freshwater dip method means placing her substrate samples in a bucket of tap water as it encourages saltwater animals to release from their holds. Lauren then elutriated (swirled) the bucket, causing the heavier sediment to fall to the bottom and the lighter amphipods to rise to top. The swirling water was slowly tipped out into a sieve.

The foundation was laid by the German physicist Max Planck, who postulated 1900 that energy can be emitted or absorbed by matter only in small, units called quanta. fundamental to the development of quantum mechanics was the uncertainty principle, formulated by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927, which states that position and a subatomic particle cannot be specified simultaneously. Spectral Lines of Atomic Hydrogen: When an electron makes a transition from energy level to the electron emits photon with a particular energy. These photons are then observed as emission lines using a spectroscope. The Lyman series involves to the lowest ground state energy level. to second energy level are called the series.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, experimental findings raised doubts about the completeness of Newtonian theory. Among the newer observations were the lines that appear in the spectra light emitted by or in which electric discharges take place. of the atom in the early 20th century by the English physicist Ernest Rutherford, in which negatively charged electrons circle a nucleus in orbits by Newton’s laws of scientists had also expected that the electrons would emit light over a broad frequency range, rather than in the narrow frequency ranges that form the lines a spectrum. Another puzzle for physicists was the coexistence two theories of light: the corpuscular theory, which explains light a stream of particles, and the wave theory, which light as electromagnetic waves. A third problem was the absence of a molecular basis for In his book Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics (1902), the mathematical physicist J. Willard Gibbs conceded the impossibility of framing a of molecular action that reconciled thermodynamics, radiation, and electrical phenomena as they were At the turn of the century, physicists did not yet recognize that these and other difficulties physics were in way related. The first development that led to the solution these difficulties was Planck’s introduction of concept of the quantum, as result of physicists’ studies blackbody radiation during the closing years of the 19th century. (The term blackbody refers to an ideal body or surface that absorbs all radiant energy without any reflection.) A body moderately high temperature — a heat\" — gives off of its radiation the low frequency (red and infrared) regions; a body at a higher temperature — \"white heat\" — off comparatively more radiation in higher (yellow, green, or blue). During the 1890s physicists conducted detailed quantitative studies of these phenomena and expressed their results in a series of curves or graphs. The classical, prequantum, theory predicted an altogether different set of curves from those actually observed. What Planck did was to devise a mathematical formula that described the curves exactly; then deduced physical hypothesis that could explain the formula. His hypothesis was that energy radiated only of energy hu, where u is the frequency and h is the quantum now known The next important in quantum mechanics were the of German-born American physicist and Nobel laureate Einstein. He used Planck’s concept of the quantum to explain properties of the photoelectric effect—an experimentally observed phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from metal surfaces when radiation falls on these surfaces. According to classical theory, the energy, as measured by the voltage of emitted electrons, should proportional to the intensity of the radiation. The energy the however, found to be independent of the intensity of radiation—which determined only the number of to depend solely on the frequency of the radiation. The higher the frequency of the incident radiation, the greater is the electron energy; below a certain critical frequency no electrons are emitted. These facts were explained by Einstein by assuming that a single quantum of radiant energy ejects a single electron from the metal. of the quantum is proportional to frequency, so the energy of the electron depends on the frequency.

Question: How do you stop a guitarist from playing? Answer: Put music in front of him. That’s me. I can’t read music and I doubt I ever will. However, over the last three I’ve learned just enough about music theory to be dangerous. What I’ve found is that by understanding basic concepts, I’ve been able next chord I was searching for. The first step in understanding is that most songs are played a single key and that the chords in the come from that key. The formula (i.e. order) you use for the chords is what make up the song. For example, blues often uses the 1, 4, and 5 chords. If you’re playing in E, the chords are E, A, B (or B7). The blues in the key of C, uses C, F, and G. If you can understand the table you’ve got the majority of theory need. |1 (root)||2||3||4||5||6||7||8 (root)| |Major||minor||Minor||Major||Major or Dominant||Minor||Diminished||Major| Here’s how to this Guitar frets are in half (H) step intervals. In other moving up one fret is moving up a half (H) step. Moving up 2 frets is a whole (W) step. Notes and intervals On a guitar, the open string and 12th fret on the same string are the same note (just different octave). If you at A the notes are: |Â or Bb||B||C||C# or Db||D||D#orEb||E||F||F#orGb||G||G#OrAb||A| go from A to B is a whole (W) To go from A to A# (or Bb) is a half (H) step. Also, note that for B to C E to F, there is only a half step. There is no B# (Cb) or E# (Fb). major has the following intervals, W W H W W W (do, rae, me fae, so la, te, do) Applying this formula, the notes in the A major scale are: B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A. As seen on guitar the A scale like: tip – On any string of the guitar, apply the formula W, W, H, W, W, W, H. In words the string: 5, 7, 11, 12. You’ve just a major scale. Numbers for the Notes We describe the notes in a scale by their numbers (1 – 8). When your playing in the Key of A, A is the 1 B is 2 – You get the idea. Chords in the major scale To find chords that will work in the key of A, take the root notes from the and use the A chord type A from the below: |Major||minor||Minor||Major||Major or Dom||Minor||Diminished||Major| 1, 4 and 5 chord are major chords (A, D, E).

The way we read now, when we are alone with ourselves, retains with the however is performed in academies. My ideal reader (and lifelong hero) is Dr. Samuel Johnson, who knew and expressed the power and the limitation of incessant reading. every other activity of the mind, it must Johnson's prime concern, which is \"what comes near to ourself, what we can to use.\" Francis Bacon, who provided some of the ideas Johnson put to use, famously gave the advice: \"Read contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to and consider.\" I add to and Johnson a third sage of reading, Emerson, fierce enemy of and of all historicisms, who remarked that the best books \"impress us the conviction, that one nature wrote and the same reads.\" Let me fuse Bacon, and Emerson a formula of how to read: find what comes near to that can be put to the weighing and considering, and that addresses you though you share the one nature, of time's tyranny. Pragmatically that means, Shakespeare, and let find you. If King fully to find you, then weigh and consider the nature shares with you; to I do not intend as an idealism, but as a pragmatism.

Be to a full reading King Lear, you will understand the origins of what you judge to be patriarchy. we read -- Johnson, and agree -- in order to strengthen the self, and to learn its authentic interests. We experience such augmentations as pleasure, which may be why aesthetic values have always been deprecated by social moralists, from Plato our current campus Puritans. The of reading are selfish rather than You cannot directly improve anyone else's life by better or more deeply. I remain skeptical the traditional social hope that care for others may be stimulated by the growth of individual imagination, and I am wary of any whatsoever that connect the pleasures of solitary reading to the public good. The sorrow of professional reading is that you recapture the pleasure of reading you knew in when books were a Hazlittian gusto. The way we read now partly depends upon our distance, or outer, from the universities, where reading is scarcely taught as pleasure, in any of the deeper senses of the aesthetics of pleasure. Opening yourself to a direct confrontation with Shakespeare his strongest, as in King Lear, is never an pleasure, whether in youth or age, and yet not to read King Lear fully (which means without expectations) is to be cognitively as well as aesthetically defrauded. A childhood largely spent watching yields to an adolescence a computer, and the university receives a student unlikely to welcome the suggestion that we must endure our hence even as our going hither: ripeness is all. Reading apart, much of the self scatters it. All this is past lamenting, and will not be remedied by any vows or programs.

Since the of the first breeding pair, there have been 140 addax at Brookfield Zoo. “We are about the addax births at Brookfield Zoo and being able to share the significance and importance of these new additions with our guests,” said Amy Roberts, curator of mammals for the Chicago Zoological Society. “What is really exciting is that there is the possibility that one of calves or their descendants may one day be introduced the wild as of a collaborative program.” The of the three new moms with Winston, who is the sire of all calves, was based on recommendation by the Association of and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan (SSP). The Chicago Zoological which manages the zoo, has been an participant in the Addax SSP since its inception in 1989.

Currently, there are 159 addax in 18 accredited North American Once widespread across North Africa, the addax has been largely driven to extinction in the wild by over-hunting since the mid-1800s as well as unrest. Additionally, although highly adapted to hyper-arid conditions, are nonetheless impacted by long periods severe drought. The current population is restricted a narrow band of desert between eastern Niger and Chad. Researchers estimate there to be less than 300 individuals remaining in the wild, with the last major population of around 200 the Tin Toumma desert of eastern Niger. However, there is hope for the species to an international effort involving zoos in North America and Europe, the Tunisian government, and the Convention on Migratory Species. Brookfield Zoo is one of more than 40 zoos worldwide that has provided support for the reintroduction of zoo-born addax into fenced reserves in Tunisia. Current efforts are focusing on securing the remaining wild populations in Niger and Chad, increasing scientific management of captive populations in Africa and elsewhere, and reintroducing individual to secure, and protected areas in former range states.

But let me make case regarding just factor and decide. There are other factors course, but I to focus on only one the moment. This one over-arching factor is the amount of energy exchange across the building enclosure. I think that higher levels of thermal resistance and reduced heat gain across enclosures has forever changed the performance of buildings—and not necessarily in a way. And things are to get worse before they get better. Sound familiar? The lens I am going to use to look at this is moisture. Why? It is one of the damage functions acting on materials along with heat and ultra-violet radiation.2 think moisture the key to understanding the performance of in general—and in this case—in specific. The consequence of this reduced energy exchange is beginning to seen over the place: part load humidity problems, rot, and corrosion. Highly insulated building enclosures with reduced heat gain have low potentials and increased interior moisture When they get wet they don’t dry. Stuff is beginning to stink, rot, break and annoy. There are two things to look at here. Levels of insulation airtight assemblies and heat gain through glazing, roof assemblies and interior loads. insulation and providing airtight assemblies reduces energy a thing right? Well, no—not always. energy flow from the inside to the outside colder on the outside of the building get in winter. The colder these things, the wetter these things get and wetter they stay. This is not good. Less energy flow from the outside to the inside in the summer and the less heat that is generated inside the summer the less the system runs. This is a good thing right? Well, always. something called “the part load humidity problem.” Higher Levels of Resistance How do we wet wood? We kiln it. We heat the wood so that the water in the wood is warmer than its surroundings. We add energy to the water and evaporates. is a huge exchange of When we put warm wet coffee beans in a room with very cold surfaces we call it freeze-drying. moisture the coffee beans and accumulates on the surfaces. There is huge exchange of energy. The greater the rate energy exchange the the rate of moisture movement. Drying cannot happen out an exchange of energy. When my Mom Dad bought their house in Toronto, Canada in 1957 there was no insulation in the walls and the house was leaky to air—it had high air change driven by a traditional chimney. We in a 1,200 square foot house and in January, when outside temperature dropped to 0 degrees Momma cranked up the 300,000 furnace to maintain an interior temperature of 70 degrees The energy flow across the building enclosure was enormous, but oil was cheap, and we were comfortable and happy. The energy flow was so enormous building enclosure was simultaneously kiln dried and freeze-dried. In fact, the drying potential was so we uncomfortably dry. As a result Poppa insisted furnace have a new fangled gadget to a humidifier. How things changed. Well what changed? We’ve begun to insulate—and insulate exceptionally well—and we’re getting the assemblies “tighter” to air change and convection. That results in two things—less energy exchange drying potential—and things on the exterior side of the enclosure are colder in the winter. Things being colder on the outside lead to something most folks don’t consider. Many building materials are hygroscopic (Figure 1). This means they absorb based on humidity.

Your immune system is bodywide of cells, tissues, organs that has to defend you against such \"foreign\" invasions.The proper targets of your immune system are infectious organisms--bacteria such as these streptococci; fungi (this one happens to be Candida, the cause of yeast infections); parasites, including these worm-like microbes that cause malaria; viruses such as this SARS virus. Markers of Self At the heart of the immune response the ability to distinguish between \"self\" and \"non-self.\" cell in your body carries the same set of distinctive surface proteins that distinguish \"self.\" Normally your immune cells do not your own tissues, which all carry the same pattern of self-markers; rather, your immune coexists with your other body cells in a state known as This set of on human cells is called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). There are two classes: MHC Class I proteins, which are on all cells, and MHC Class II proteins, are only on certain specialized cells. Markers of Non-Self non-self substance capable of triggering an immune response is known as an antigen. An antigen can be a whole non-self cell, a bacterium, a virus, an MHC marker protein or even a portion of a protein from a foreign organism. distinctive markers on antigens that trigger an immune response are called epitopes. When tissues or cells from another individual enter your body such antigenic non-self epitopes, your immune cells react. This why transplanted tissues may be rejected as foreign and antibodies will bind to Markers of Self: Major Histocompatibility Complex Your cells recognize major histocompatibility complex proteins(MHC) when they distinguish and non-self. An MHC protein serves as a recognizable scaffold that presents pieces (peptides) of a foreign protein (antigenic) to immune cells. An empty \"foreign\" MHC scaffold itself can as an antigen when donor organs or cells are introduced into a patient's body. These MHC self-marker scaffolds are also as a patient's \"tissue type\" or as human leukocyte (HLA) when a patient's white blood cells are being characterized. For example, when the immune system of a patient receiving a kidney transplant detects a non-self \"tissue type,\" the body may its own immune cells to attack. Every cell in your body is covered with these MHC self-marker proteins, and--except for identical twins--individuals carry different sets. MHC proteins are as distinct as types and come in categories--MHC Class humans bear 6 markers out 200 possible variations; and MHC Class II: humans 8 out of about 230 possibilities. Organs of the Immune System The organs of your immune system are positioned throughout your body. They are called lymphoid organs because they are home to lymphocytes--the white blood cells that are key operatives of the immune system. these organs, the lymphocytes grow, develop, are deployed. Bone marrow, the soft tissue in the hollow center of is the ultimate source all blood cells, including the immune cells. The thymus is an organ that behind breastbone; lymphocytes known as T lymphocytes, or just T cells, mature there. The spleen is a flattened organ at the upper left the Like lymph nodes, the spleen contains where immune cells gather and confront In addition to these organs, clumps of lymphoid tissue are found in many parts of the body, especially in linings of the digestive tract and the airways and lungs--gateways to the body. These tissues include the tonsils, adenoids, and appendix. The organs of your immune system are connected with one another and with organs of the body by a network of lymphatic vessels. Lymphocytes can travel throughout body the blood vessels. The cells can travel through system lymphatic vessels that closely parallels the body's veins arteries. Cells and fluids are exchanged between blood and lymphatic vessels, enabling the lymphatic system to monitor the body for invading microbes. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a clear fluid that bathes the body's tissues.

He was from rich, noble family and received thorough education. He refused to enter an honorable marriage proposed by father and decided to devote himself to the service of the Church. Placing himself under the direction of Peter, Archdeacon of Aosta, under whose guidance he rapidly progressed, Bernard was ordained priest and account his learning and virtue was made Archdeacon of (966), having charge of the government of the diocese under the bishop. Seeing the ignorance and idolatry still prevailing among people of the resolved to devote himself to their conversion. forty two years he continued to preach the Gospel to these people and carried the light of faith even into many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numerous conversions and working miracles. For another reason, Bernard's name will forever be famous history. Since the ancient times there was a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the valley of Aosta to the Swiss canton of Valais, over what is now the pass of the Great St. Bernard. pass is covered with perpetual snow from seven to feet deep, and drifts sometimes accumulate to the of forty Though the pass extremely dangerous, especially in the springtime on account of avalanches, yet it was often used by French and German pilgrims on their way to Rome. For the convenience and of travelers St. Bernard founded and hospice at the highest point the pass, feet sea-level, in the year A few years later he established another hospice on the Little St. Bernard, a of the Graian Alps, 7,076 feet above sea-level. were placed in charge of Augustinian monks after pontifical approval had been obtained by him during a visit to Rome. These hospices renowned generous hospitality extended to all travelers over the Great Little St. Bernard, so called honor of the founder these charitable institutions. At all seasons the year, but especially during heavy snow-storms, the heroic monks accompanied by their well-trained dogs, go out in search of victims who may have succumbed to the severity weather. They offer food, clothing, and shelter to the unfortunate travelers take care of the dead. They depend on gifts and collections for sustenance. At present, order consists of forty the majority of whom live at the hospice while some have charge of neighboring parishes. The last of Bernard's life was the reconciliation of two noblemen whose strife threatened a fatal issue. He was the cloister of Lawrence. Venerated as a saint from the in many of Piedmont (Aosta, Novara, Brescia ), was not canonized until 1681, by Innocent XI. feast celebrated on the 15th of June.

Instead of a magnetic field, the cells have signals to guide the which they grow. As plant tissues during growth, the orientation and axis molecular signals become patterned from early stage within the bud, helping the leaf shape to emerge. The researchers filmed a growing Arabidopsis leaf, a relative of oil seed rape, to help create a model which could simulate the growing process. They were able film individual cells and track them as the plant grew. It also unpick the workings behind the changes and to test them normal and plants. \"The just based on drawings of leaf shape at different stages,\" said Professor Enrico Coen. \"To accurately recreate dynamic growth from bud to we had to establish the mathematical governing how leaf shapes are formed.\" With this knowledge programmed into model, developed in collaboration with Professor Andrew Bangham's team at the University of East it can independently to build virtual but realistic leaf. Professor Douglas Kell, Chief Executive of BBSRC said: \"This exciting research highlights of using computer and models for biological research to help us tackle questions and make predictions the future. Computational modelling can give us deeper and more rapid understanding of the biological systems that are vital to life earth.\" The model could now used to help identify the genes control shape and whether different different shapes. \"This simple model could account for basic development and growth of all leaf shapes,\" said Fox. \"The more we understand about how grow, the better we prepare for our future -- providing food, fuel and preserving diversity.\"",

The scientist is a member of a team of astronomers whose recent work on planet formation around TW Hydrae was announced afternoon. Their work used data from ESA’s space observatory, which has the sensitivity at the needed wavelengths for scanning TW Hydrae’s protoplanetary disk, along with the capability taking spectra for the telltale molecules they were looking for. But getting observing time on mission like is not easy and funding committees expect results, fact that didn’t daunt the researcher. Says Henning, “If there’s no chance your project can fail, you’re probably not doing very interesting science. TW Hydrae is a good example how a calculated scientific gamble can pay off.” I would the relevant powers be happy with this team’s The situation is this: TW Hydrae is a young star of about Solar masses some 176 light years away. The proximity is significant: This is closest protoplanetary disk to Earth with gas emission lines, some two and a half times closer than the next possible and thus intensely studied for the it offers into formation.

New measurements using Herschel space have the mass of the disk is greater than previously thought. Credit: Axel M. Quetz (MPIA). The challenge of TW Hydrae, though, has been total mass of the molecular hydrogen gas in its disk remained unclear, leaving us without a good idea of the particulars of how infant system might produce Molecular hydrogen does emit detectable radiation, while basing a mass estimate on carbon is hampered by the opacity of the disk. For that matter, basing a mass estimate on the thermal emissions of dust grains astronomers to make guesses about the opacity of the dust, so we’re left with uncertainty — mass values have been estimated anywhere between 0.5 and 63 Jupiter masses, and that’s a lot of play. Error bars like these have left us guessing about the properties of this disk. The new work takes different tack. While hydrogen don’t emit measurable radiation, hydrogen molecules that contain a deuterium atom, in which the atomic nucleus contains not just a proton but an additional neutron, emit significant amounts of with an intensity that depends upon the temperature of the gas. Because ratio of deuterium to hydrogen is relatively constant near the Sun, a detection of hydrogen deuteride can be out to produce a solid estimate of the amount of hydrogen in the disk. The Herschel data astronomers to set a lower limit for disk mass at Jupiter the most useful part this being that this estimate has an uncertainty ten times than the results. A this massive should be able to a planetary larger than the Solar which scientists believe was produced by a much lighter disk. When Henning spoke about taking risks, he doubtless referred to fact that this was only the second hydrogen deuteride has detected outside the Solar System. The pitch to the Herschel committee had to be persuasive to get them sign off on so tricky a detection. But 36 Herschel observations (with total exposure time of almost seven hours) allowed to find the hydrogen deuteride they were looking for in the far-infrared. Water in the atmosphere this kind of radiation, which is why a space-based detection the only reasonable choice, although the evidently considered flying observatory SOFIA, platform on which they were unlikely to approval given the problematic nature of the observation.

In the late 1700s and early the idea of atoms reemerged in response to questions about the of matter, the nature of fire, and the basis of chemical phenomena. 9-12: 10F/H3. In the British and physicist John Dalton united the concepts of atoms and elements. He proposed two ideas laid the groundwork for modern chemistry: first, that elements are formed from small, indivisible particles called atoms, which are identical for a given element but different from any other element; and second, that chemical compounds formed from atoms by combining a definite number of each type of atom to form one of the compound. 9-12: 10F/H4.

The charge of the electron e is used as a unit of charge in much of physics. Electron pairs within an orbital system have opposite spins due to the Pauli exclusion principle; this characteristic pairing allows electrons to exist in quantum orbital, as the opposing magnetic dipole moments induced by each of the electrons ensures that they are attracted together.

After many years of thinking and research I could come up only with three ways which the growth of human can be reduced to zero or made negative, if that were necessary for the survival of our species. a) By war, with or without weapons of mass destruction, starvation, disease, ethnic rape, mutilation, and other horrors. most likely would occur as got close to the carrying capacity of the and almost certainly occur humankind reached or exceeded the earth's carrying capacity. b) By the voluntary action of all of humanity. This most likely would occur prior to reaching the carrying capacity of the Earth. Of course, this also could happen after humanity reached or exceeded the carrying capacity the Earth and be used reduce the human population to capacity of the Earth without violence---provided the horrors in (a) above have not commenced. This action would include education of women, raising their standard of living, modifying the culture of societies, increasing the standard of living of all of humanity, and many other actions of similar nature. Voluntary action includes any and all non-violent humankind could take to reduce population growth to zero or make it negative except coercive action. c) By the coercive action of society limiting the number of children a person or a couple could produce. This likely would occur to reaching the carrying of the Earth. Of it could also be used to reduce human population to the carrying capacity of the Earth after humanity has exceeded the carrying capacity the provided the horrors in (a) have not commenced. There isn't a single accepted definition of \"carrying capacity\". For the purposes of this essay define \"carrying capacity\" as the number of human beings combined with the average per of resources which will permit that number of human beings to exist and survive on this planet for a minimum of 1000 years. An alternative definition of \"carrying capacity\" is the number of human beings combined with the average per capita usage of resources which if exceeded even for a short period of time result in the inability of the Earth provide necessary for civilization to continue causing a rapid and horrendous in the human population. While one what the carrying capacity of the Earth may be, it cannot be infinite-- it be finite. No matter how much the average per capita usage of resources is reduced the Earth could not support 1 trillion beings. Similarly, the per capita of resources were increased such that each human being used times the amount of resources used by the average American is highly unlikely that the Earth could support 1 human beings. At present human population is It is highly likely that the average per capita usage of resources will continue to increase due to the rapidly growing economies of India and China and the economies of the other nations of the world. Therefore, a case can be made that humanity will shortly exceed the carrying capacity of the Earth, if humanity already has not exceeded that capacity. If humanity exceeds the carrying capacity and takes no action to reduce the population and/or the usage of resources to reduce it's impact on the planet below carrying capacity, then humans will enter into a violent competitions for the resources necessary survive and the horrors set forth 1(a) will occur. In simple terms, it will be each and man/group/religion/nation/culture against every other man/group/religion/nation/culture in order to obtain resources which the Earth provide so that the individual survives-- pure violent Darwinism. Billions will die and die and more importantly the catastrophe will use up and/or destroy any remaining resources such that civilization will be unable to forever or at least thousands of years 2.

Researchers investigate dispensability of our DNA| October 2, 2008 Our genome contains many genes encoding proteins that are similar to those of other organisms, suggesting evolutionary relationships; however, protein-coding genes for only a small fraction genome, and there many other that are conserved across species. What these sequences doing, and do we really need at all? a study published online today in Genome Research (www.genome.org), have delved into this mystery and found that evolution has actively kept them in our genome. Before human genome was sequenced, estimated the contain upwards of 140,000 protein-coding genes, but surprisingly, sequencing revealed only about 20,000, accounting for less than 2% the entire genome. Previously, Dr. Bejerano of Stanford University found that lurking within other 98% of the genome are stretches of sequences, known as ultraconserved elements, which are identical humans and animals such as rodents and chickens, though hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution separates them. Other evidence has suggested that sequences can harbor critical functions, such as of the activity of genes. Yet research in this has laboratory results that are seemingly disagreement: some ultraconserved elements can be deleted the genome and produce no observable effect on mice. Bejerano cautions that experiments such as these not be to detect evolutionary forces at work. \"With this in mind, we set out to examine genomic data, much as someone would examine archaeological data, in search of similar deletion events that have happened naturally, and more importantly, were retained in the wild.\" \"An analogy I like to entertain that of tectonics: fraction of the phenomena may be enough be directly measured by our instruments, to appreciate its full magnitude we must dig into the geological record,\" said Bejerano. \"This digging into record is what our current work was all about. Bejerano and graduate student Cory McLean studied the genomes of six mammals, investigating ultraconserved elements that are shared between primates and closely mammals, were present in the ancestor of modern rodents, but have lost in the rodent lineage more recently. The researchers found that the genomic evidence supports an important biological role for ultraconserved as well as thousands of other non-coding elements that are resistant to deletion. \"The importance of elements is reinforced the observation that the elements rarely lost in any species,\" said McLean. \"In fact, they are over 300-fold less to be lost than genomic loci which evolve neutrally in our genome.\" Bejerano explained that while of some elements may have a significant impact on the fitness of a species and the loss of other elements might be harder to detect the laboratory, all changes these are up by evolution swept out of the population. \"Perhaps our most striking observation is one of sheer magnitude,\" Bejerano said. \"Our work how essential these dozens of thousands of regions are to the natural evolution of species even as their actual functions remain, at large, a mystery.\" Scientists from Stanford University (Stanford, CA) contributed this study.

But scientists now believe they know why some humans are more likely to show aggression than others, after they managed to block pathological rage in mice. Researchers found that overly hostile mice and angry men biological similarities which them more susceptible - a major breakthrough which could pave the way for new treatments for conditions including Alzheimer's disease Breakthrough: Researchers found that overly hostile and angry men share biological similarities which make them more susceptible to rage In a study published the of Neuroscience, researchers from the University of Southern California and Italy identified a brain in mice, which malfunctions in overly hostile rodents. When the scientists shut down the receptor, which also exists in humans, the excess aggression disappeared. The findings are expected to help experts develop drug targets for pathological which is a component in Alzheimer's, autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Marco Bortolato, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of pharmacology and sciences at the USC School of Pharmacy, told Science Daily: 'From a clinical point of view, reactive aggression is absolutely a major problem. 'We want to find the tools that might reduce impulsive violence.' Scientists had found that both humans and mice respond violently to stress if they have low levels of the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO A). Similarities: found that both male humans mice respond violently to if they have levels of the monoamine oxidase A 'The same type of mutation that study in mice is associated with criminal, very violent in humans,' Bortolato said. 'But really didn't understand why that is.' Bortolato and his USC colleague Jean worked backwards replicate elements of human pathological aggression mice. This meant not only low enzyme levels but also the interaction of genetics with early stressful events, such as trauma and childhood neglect. levels of MAO A are one basis of the predisposition to in humans,' Bortolato. 'The other is an encounter with maltreatment, and the combination of the two factors appears to be deadly. 'It results consistently in in adults.' The research that, in excessively aggressive lackomh MAO A, high levels of electrical stimulus are required to a specific receptor in the brain. Even when this brain receptor does work, stays active only for a short period time. Bortolato said: 'The fact that blocking this moderates aggression is why this discovery has so much potential. It may have important applications therapy. 'Whatever the ways environment can persistently affect behaviour - and even personality over the long term behaviour is ultimately supported by biological mechanisms.'",

Indeed, it is almost unique in the area one of the towns that has never had a natural spring – the water for the town was piped in from natural springs a couple of kilometers away. Nobody seems sure as to why it is called “Los Gallardos”, the most common explanation being that it was the name given to the rich foreigners who settled there at the turn of the last A “Gallardo” in Spanish was a gentleman, and the name was given engineers and investors who came to exploit the mines of Bedar. An alternate theory, expounded to me by a 90 year old man who heard it from his when he was was that came man who built the first house where Los Gallardos now is – a rich sailor from Mojacar, who disliked Mojacar and brought a plot of land next to the old Almeria – Vera route.

Since the Almeria – Vera route ran past Los Gallardos (the actual CN340 that runs the village), and a track split off to go Bedar and Lubrin, it the place for the (mainly British) engineers and investors to settle for their base. Bedar was where the miners lived; Los Gallardos the owners. of communication that point to all the mines in the area, plus Garrucha (the main port) meant that it was easier for them to a new base there rather then flog and down the track to which in those days would have taken the better part of a day. Los Gallardos was part of Bedar until 1924, when it was incorporated as a municipio, or a town (Bedar has mentioned in the records since before 1505, when the position of Bedar created in order to cement Christianity in the mountains). Until the latter part of 1910s was a much larger community then Los Gallardos, being the main work base. mines close to Bedar started to close, the miners moved to new exploitations, a net loss of population and a small surge in the (now often abandoned) villages in the mountains. The truth of the matter was that the intense mining activity that took place at the end of the 19th century, and whose and technical centre was based in Los Gallardos, created and consolidated a large number of villages in the such as Bedar, Garrucha, Seron, El Pinar others.

Whether engineers are creating complex image processing applications or designing systems that extend battery life by working swiftly before returning to sleep mode, speed is a critical factor in a product's success. Though hardware usually first consideration when design teams look for ways improve speed, that's not the most effective path. It's straightforward to run the features and functions of a faster without any hardware changes. Streamlining software so it runs at optimal rates can bring significant improvements in a way that's so easy to implement in the field be enhanced. That's far more cost effective than redesigning hardware. Three of the four basic components system speed are operating systems, compilers and application software. Hardware is the critical fourth phase, but altering processors, memories, bus architectures and data channels is difficult. Altering the system is also difficult once OS has been selected. That leaves optimizing the software that runs above the system as the straightforward way to increase speed. Applications packages, middleware and drivers take center stage development teams focus on the features and that attract But this software is typically overlooked when the shifts to performance. That's a mistake. Significant increases can be achieved when acceleration are applied to software that resides above the operating system.

This is true with micro and macroeconomics, micro and macro evolution, microorganism, micro lens and macro lens, micro finance and macro and so on. The list words that makes use of these is long and exhaustive. Many people confuse between micro and macro despite knowing that these prefixes signify small and large respectively. article takes a closer look at the two to find out their differences. To understand the difference between micro and macro, let us take up the example and macro evolution. To signify that takes place within a single species, the word microevolution is used whereas evolution that transcends the boundaries of species and takes place on a very large scale is termed as macroevolution. Though the principles of evolution such as genetics, natural selection, and migration remain the same across microevolution as well as macro evolution, this distinction between microevolution and macroevolution is a great way to explain this natural phenomenon. Another field of study that makes use of micro and macro is economics. While the study of overall economy and how works is called macroeconomics, microeconomics focuses on the individual person, company, or industry. Thus, the study of employment, inflation etc. in an economy classified under macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of forces demand and supply inside a particular industry effecting the goods and it macroeconomics when economists choose to concentrate upon the state the economy in a nation whereas the study of single market or industry remains within the realms of microeconomics. There is also the study of finance where these two are used. Thus, we have microfinance where the focus is upon the monetary needs and requirements of a single individual where there is also macro financing by the banks or other financial institutions is of very large nature. Micro and macro are derived from Greek language where micro means small and macro refers to large. These prefixes are used in many fields of study such as finance, economics, evolution etc. where we have words like micro and macro finance, micro evolution and macro evolution etc. Studying something at small level is micro while studying it on a large scale is macro analysis.

Harvesting energy directly from abundant solar radiation using solar cells is increasingly emerging as a major component of future global energy strategy, Mitra said. Yet, it comes to harnessing renewable energy, challenges remain. Expensive, large-scale infrastructures, as windmills or dams, are necessary to drive renewable energy sources, such as wind or hydroelectric power plants. Purified silicon, also used for making computer chips, which continue to rise in demand, is a core material for fabricating conventional solar cells. the processing a such as silicon is beyond reach of most consumers. “Developing organic cells from polymers, however, is a cheap and potentially simpler alternative,” Mitra said. “We great deal of interest in our work because solar cells can inexpensively printed or painted on exterior building walls and/or rooftops. Imagine some day driving in your hybrid car with a solar panel painted on the roof, which is producing electricity drive the engine. The opportunities are endless.” The cell at NJIT uses a carbon nanotubes complex, which is a molecular configuration of carbon in a shape. Although estimated to be times smaller than a hair, just one nanotube can conduct current better than any conventional electrical wire. Mitra and his research team took the carbon nanotubes and combined them with tiny carbon fullerenes (sometimes known as buckyballs) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, they can’t make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, then be to make electrons or current flow. “Someday, I hope see this process become an inexpensive energy alternative for households around the world,” Mitra said.

The vines can grow and survive when conditions exist such as an acid peat soil, an adequate supply of fresh water for irrigation and periodic flooding, supply sand and a growing season that extends from April to November. There are two main of harvesting cranberries - dry and wet harvesting. EDEN Organic Dried Cranberries are a native American Vaccinium organically grown on family owned cranberry bogs in Québec, Canada.

Cranberries native to North and were first used centuries ago by native Americans. versatile fruit, they discovered that it could be used not only as a food source, but also a dye for rugs, blankets and clothing, and as a healing plant to treat arrow wounds. American had many names for the cranberry such as 'sasamanesh, ibimi, and atogua'. To the Delaware Indians it was a of peace. Many Americans believed that berries had a special power that could calm the nerves. It's current name comes early Dutch and German settlers who named fruit, 'crane berry', because its small, pink blossoms resembled the and bill of a Sandhill crane. Although folklore and anecdotal accounts of cranberries healthful properties (especially the benefits to urinary tract health) have been touted centuries, it is that scientific research began how healthful cranberries can be. Packed with nutrients like antioxidants and other natural compounds, cranberries are great choice for the health conscious. The USDA found that the high phenolic content in cranberries delivers a potent antioxidant punch, rating it one of the highest out of 20 common fruits rated. To determine the antioxidant activity of various foods, the USDA uses a system referred to as Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). By testing the ability of foods and compounds to subdue oxygen free USDA was able to determine each antioxidant capability.

In either case, the proposed amendment(s) must be ratified by three-fourths of the states. is a very good reason why all 27 amendments the Constitution were offered by Congressional resolution: a Constitutional Convention is invitation to disaster. Proponents of a Constitutional Convention claim that opponents of a use \"…half-truths, myths and outright falsehoods…\" to instill fear of the process. They do not, however, provide any examples of the \"half-truths, myths, and falsehoods.\" Here is the whole truth, which is a myth nor a falsehood. Article V of the Constitution states apply to the Congress Constitutional Convention. Should of the states issue such an application, Congress is compelled to call a Constitutional Convention. Note, however, that the Constitution provides the states with the authority call for a convention for the \"…proposing amendments….\" There is no authority for to specify what those might be, to set, or limit the agenda of a convention. When 34 states have for a Constitutional Congress is compelled to call Here's where the scary begins. Congress sets the and for the Con-Con. Congress determines how delegates are chosen, and how delegates will be chosen. Congress could designate the existing Senate to be the delegates. Congress could designate the Electoral College the Presidential election to be the delegates. Or, Congress could allow states to their own delegates in whatever manner Congress might contrive. But this is not the scariest part. Should a Convention ever be assembled, neither Congress nor any state would have any authority or control over what the might There is no way for Congress set or limit the agenda of a Constitutional Convention, regardless of what proponents might say. As evidence, consider the only Constitutional Convention that was ever assembled. It was assembled expressly to amend the existing Articles of with instructions some for delegates to walk out should the convention stray beyond this specific purpose. History demonstrates that the convention ignored its instructions and abolished the Articles while an entirely new Constitution. There is nothing to prohibit another convention from doing precisely the same thing. Proponents of Con-Con say that the requirement that three-fourths of the states must ratify whatever comes out of a Constitutional Amendment is to radicals on either side from imposing radical provisions. These folks forget that the convention can specify what takes to ratify whatever they produce. They could produce a new Constitution with an entirely new form of government and specify that ratification would upon a simple majority vote in national referendum. They could specify that the new document be ratified when approved by state legislatures in any combination of states that represent more 50-percent of the population. Under this a of blue states could transform the government of the United States. Scary? You bet. Scenarios such as this should instill and force people to the of a Constitutional convention for any reason. Here is a thorough of the dangers. There is need, however, to the Constitution. imbalance in powers between the states and the federal government grows in the favor of the feds every time meets or speaks. The United of America was unique experiment in shared sovereignty - in which the states' power was centered in Senate, which had to approve virtually every legislative proposal by the President or that originated in the people's House of Representatives. The tension between what the states considered to be in their interest, what the people's representatives and the President considered to be in their interests a competition that could not move any forward until all parties had agreed. This is the genius of the American System that made America the greatest nation on Earth. The 17th Amendment removed states altogether from in the federal government.

After World War II Australia shared in an economic boom created by the rejuvenation of the world economy. Work was plentiful and to ease labour shortages introduced an immigration program, which added to the economic momentum. These were good times, coming after years of depression and war which had restricted consumer spending and household formation, but the building industry was unable to meet the demand for housing. For around 15 years after the war, shortages of labour and building materials meant that income earners had to downscale of housing space, style and amenity. Many built their own houses, or provided unskilled to cut construction costs and delays. houses were smaller and expensive than before the war. As Robin Boyd put it, 'the traditional plan and structure remained unaltered, but one by one the decorations and embellishments went'. This simple weatherboard house, built in outer suburban Melbourne in 1955, was typical. Modest and unadorned, enabled the owners to live and raise a family in a suburban setting, during a period of escalating building costs. In 1948 John 'Jack' a toolmaker from Coventry, migrated to Australia. in 1919, he was still single and by making new start in a new land he hoped to put sadness of the war in his mother and brother had been killed the Blitz, behind him. After stints as a mechanical fitter at Yallourn, as a gold miner in Kalgoorlie, Jack worked as a toolmaker around Melbourne. He was never out of work until the day he retired. He met Gwen an Australian, and they married in 1954. Jack in the 'bush' his Lewellin Grove block, 1955. lived with her parents in Carrum, a seaside on Port Phillip Bay, around 35 kilometres from Melbourne. was located at the edge of a large area of swampland had been drained and made available for selection during the Like of the small towns along the Bay, Carrum in 1945 was ready to blossom as a suburb. The railway to Frankston had been electrified the 1920s and provided an excellent service for commuters. A fine beach was and there were ample homesites, their cheapness compensating for the of sewers made roads. Carrum would never be a salubrious suburb because it was flat and flood-prone, but area had useful community facilities, including a primary school, and a high school. After they married the Frosts lived with Gwen's parents. They the area and bought a nearby block of land. Close to the school, station and beach, it was an ideal homesite, but a lot of work was needed before a house be built on it. The lot was covered in tea-trees and banksias the road was a sand dune. But land was cheap, and only £300; similar lots in nearby Chelsea, served by made roads, around double the price. The co-operative society said they didn't mind me building the house long as I had each progressive stage checked by a qualified builder. man who sold me the land recommended a builder. 'I've people who try to build their own and then get into all of difficulties', the builder said. 'Why don't let build it you and you can do as of the building and painting as you can yourself.' The Frosts chose a design within their price range from the builder's book of plans. A fibro-cement garage was included in the price. Jack was earning little more than the basic wage, which in 1955 was than £12 per week. New three-bedroom in Melbourne's outer suburbs typically cost around £3,000. The Frosts could only afford to borrow £2,500, was still over four times their annual household income. This indicates how difficult things were at the time for working-class families.

Many families in Carrum responded to these high costs by building basic bungalows at the rear of their property and living in them until they could afford to build a full-size house. The Frosts instead chose to compromise their living space. Their house only 11 before the war 15 squares closer to the norm. It had only two bedrooms; luckily, this did not cause accommodation problems later, for Gwen and Jack's two children were boys (in the late the lack of space was alleviated when Jack built a fibro-cement bungalow in the backyard, which became a third bedroom).

And the coolest about circuits like these? can make at home. In what follows, we combine basic electronics (an LED Throwie) and papercraft (a origami balloon) to called “LED Foldie.” circuitry of aluminum foil traces, ironed onto adhesive paper such as freezer paper, photo mounting paper, or even a laser printed pattern. Something constructed this can then be folded so fit an LED and battery to the circuit. The first step in designing a three-dimensional circuit like this is to see where the parts go. After that we will unfold the draw circuit between the points that we want to connect, and from there. To get started, we first folded an origami balloon, and then inserted the components where we them. The balloon has a convenient pocket on the side for a coin cell, and a single hole allows you to point an LED into the interior of the balloon. you can follow along with balloon folding in this flickr We marked up the locations of the battery and LED terminals on the origami still folded– and then unfolded “circuit board.” At this point, we have the component locations marked, but no drawn between them. The next step is to add circuitry lines (circuit board wires, or traces) the battery and LED. One thing keep in mind for interfacing papercraft to electronics: it’s helpful if the traces fold over the leads the LED in order good After connecting the dots (so to speak) we have the resulting layout of our circuit. (See PDF below as well.) Pretty simple here– only two wires! The two round contact the two sides of the and the two angled contact the two leads of the LED. The next step is to our circuit board. We’ve actually found two slightly different techniques that work well, so we’ll show both. First is the “Freezer paper” method (which also works sheets of mount adhesive), where you laminate foil traces the plastic-coated paper. Second is the “Direct Toner” method, where you print a circuit diagram on a laser printer laminate the foil to the printed toner. (Both of methods fabricating paper circuitry can be applied in all kinds of other arenas besides origami. Our origami balloon example provides a good demonstration of the techniques!) METHOD I: The “Freezer paper” method Next, cut out your traced pattern. Scissors work well, of course. Be careful tear foil! Prefolding your paper and comparing to your layout will show you where to lay the aluminum foil pieces out your Then, use an iron to laminate the foil to the paper. What kind of The easiest (but slightly obscure) choice is “dry mount adhesive,” which is tissue paper infused high-quality hot-melt glue. You can get sheets or rolls of it from art supply places for in mounting artwork and photography. Much more common equally workable is freezer paper. paper is a common plastic-coated paper that get rolls at grocery store– look in the section with the foil. (Place foil on the side of paper). used hobby iron to fuse the to our different papers, but a regular just as well. The dry mount adhesive did not require much heat, while the freezer paper needed the iron to be on high– that has to melt. We folded a sheet of parchment paper over whole circuit during ironing in order to the from sticking to the iron and other surfaces. We experimented with waxed paper, which was not sticky enough the aluminum foil. We even tried ironing copper leaf onto paper, and though it adhered well, it was too fragile and the traces broke upon folding. It would probably work reasonably well an application where folding isn’t required: It was absolutely beautiful and completely for origami. Once the foil is adhered to paper, it is time to refold it.

Although Martin earlier supported the dino-bird he eventually realized in the light of his that it was invalid, and abandoned his former ideas: Every time look at the evidence formerly discovered and then make a claim about the origins of the theropod, I saw its inaccuracy. That is everything shows its inadequacy. The the matter is that…I seriously that they have the same features with birds and don't think that there exist striking features supporting that birds are of theropod origin. 171 Feduccia admits that concerning the origin the theory of evolution finds itself in a state of uncertainty. He attaches no credence to the deliberately maintained dino-bird controversy, which is in fact groundless. Important information is contained in his article, \"Birds Are Dinosaurs: Simple Answer to a Complex Problem,\" published in October 2002 in The Auk, the journal of the American Ornithologists' Union, in the most technical aspects of ornithology are discussed. Feduccia detail how the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs, raised by John Ostrom in the 1970s and fiercely defended ever since, lacks any scientific evidence, and such an evolution is impossible. Feduccia not alone among evolutionists in this regard.

Lows: pressure areas are important to flying weather than high pressure areas because the lows make inclemencies that challenge us. The circulation around low counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and air flows around and into low and circulates upward. Low pressure areas always move, though they can become stationary or erratic in their movement. The normal movement of a low is with the wind flow at the 500-millibar level, or about 18,000 feet. The charts will show the projected movement of lows, or you can look the 18,000-foot wind and visualize movement. Upper are that: complete circulations aloft. are complex, it is difficult to forecast formation, movement or dissipation of an upper and they can make nasty weather a wide area. Called cut-off or closed lows aloft, if one is overhead nearby, the best surface forecast is for continuous clag. Any surface low might not be directly below low aloft, and the air swirling the surface then up into the low aloft can be quite bothered. Bad place to fly. Fronts: They come in cold, warm, stationary or occluded versions. The cold variety can spawn serious thunderstorms, especially when the low is strong the temperature difference on the warm and cold side of the front is fronts make for inclement weather over a wider area can harbor embedded thunderstorms. Occluded fronts, generally found where a cold front overtakes warm front because of an circulation low, can make for nasty, bumpy flying. This is true just as the fronts are starting to occlude. as far away from the driving low as possible. Stationary fronts come when a low peters out or moves so far away that the is no longer strong enough to move the fronts. The weather might stay bad for days in a stationary frontal zone and only the development of a strong new will change things. If all the parameters for a front are not the condition be a trough and, to a pilot, might seem for all the world like a real front. Source Regions:That's simply where the air is coming from. Visualize the flow around the low if the source of the low-level air along your route as in that coming from the oceans or the Gulf of Mexico or California, then there will be plenty ingredients for clouds and rain.

If wind forecast is incorrect, then the other forecasts might be Generally, wind that is more or easterly than forecast the surface weather will be than forecast.
