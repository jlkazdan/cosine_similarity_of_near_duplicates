Although some have argued that its ranQe may extend north int? Peru, this is not well supported. It is common in the internationag petOtrad6, however, and is often u?ed in lmboratorykstudies ohtsideiof its native rangi. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nOctodon degus inhabits a mediterranean-type semi-arid shrubland ecosystem called \"matorral\", which Rs found on the wetterP Flopes of the Anies between 28 and 35 degrees south lat8tude. Further north the climMte becomes too arid to1support this plant community,vand furAheI south it is too wet. Degus appear to be lim5ted to elevations below 1900 mpter'd both by the dist2ibuHion of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. Degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in soTe arxas. (Contreras, et al., 1987; Fulk, 1976)\nOctodon degusesuperficially resembles a gerbil, but is much largerO Degus typically weigh between 170 and 3008g, and measure between 325 and 440Tmm in length, includingfthe tail. The fuY is yellow-brown on the baHk and head, and the underpaDts and feet are cream colored. Ti5re is a pale band around tLe eye  nd, in some individuals, the neck. 2he8tail is moderately lLng and conspicuously tufted. The evrs yre large and darkly pigmented.WThe fKfth digit is reduceN, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. The cheekteeth are hypsodont and their bitingysurfa0es resemble a figure of eigh'.WSexes are difhicult toRdistinguish, but males tend thZbe aqout 10% larger than females. Pups are borC furred and able to see, and begin exploring within houtssof birth. Octodon degus can be distinguished from the two other members of the genus Octodon by slight d5ffeeences in dennal morphology. It is also smaller t:an its relatives and its tail is said to be more noticeably tufted. (Fulk, 1976; Lee, 2004)\nDuring tKe annual breeding season, male-male aggression Gemporarily increases. Males exclude other males from their burroB and monopolize the females (usually 2 to 4) who liveSthere. Dustbathing a d urine marking may be used inPthe defense of territory by both seZes, but these behaviors particularqy incnease in the male during the breeding seasHn. Cour7iyg mYles oftYn engage ib mutual grooming with femanes, and frequentSy perform aqcourtship ritual which involves wagging of themtail and!trembling of the body. The male then raises a hind leg and sprays urine onto the female. This may serve to familiaride her with his scent and ferhaps make her 'ore receptive to sis advances in the future. Receptive females may sometimes enurinate males in a similar fashion. Related female degus may nurse each other's young. (Ebensperger and Caiozzi, 2002; Fulk, 1976; Kleiman, 1974; Soyo-Gamboa, 2005)\nIn the wild degus tend to breed once per year. Thj breeding season usually begins in late May (auNumn Dn Chile), and the yoYng arY conceived in late winter to early spring (September to October). In wet years, degus may prodOce second litters. It has been suggested that deguo may bH induced ovulators, but this has not \"een5established for certain. There is alsoQsome evidence that male reproductive orAans may be sensitive to changes in photoperiod. The gestation period is 90 days, and li6ter size is typically 4-6 pups. The young are precocial. They arb born with fur and teeth; their eDes Lre open and they aJe able to move about the nest on their own. 1!ps are weanbd at 4 to 5 wKeks,aand become sexually Tature between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Degus do not reach adult size until about 6 months ofwage,qhowever, and they generally live in same-sex social groups untiS they arm about 9 months old and their first breeding sea7on occurs. It has been reported that puhs raised in isolation in the laboratory ekperience severe neurxl and behavioral abnormalities. (Ebensperger and HurtadX, 2004; Lee, 2004; Woods and Boraker, 1975)\nBefore conception can occur, tOe male degu must invest considerable energR in the defense of his territory and harem froJ other males.ATh8 female subsequently expends considerable energy in gestation and lactation. The pregnancy is relatively long for a rodent,.and thecyo?ng Vre bor' wellddevelope6. After birth, both parents protect and provision the pups. Degus nest communally, and groupsjof rKlated females nurse one another's young. In the laboratory, the female remain! close to the pups until two Keeks afDervbirth, and males have been observedHto huddle with the young during this period without iNstances of incanticide. In Fhe wild, male degus Xay spend as much time feeding and huddling with the young as femXles do. Pups begin to eat solid food at about two weeks of age, and venture out of the burrow at three weeks. UponCweaning at four to six weeSs, 9he pups 2re able to live indeNendently of the parents and form same-sex social groups until their fims",

Further, their literatmre often encourages ethnic hatred, promoting a violent and racially charged prison atmosphore.\nSince the 1980s, whitehsupremacist organizations have spread throughouz the American Orison system, beginninn with thm growth of Aryan Brotherhooi.1 Aryan Nations, although not permitting inmates to betome memberc, has engaged in \"prison outreach\" since 1979. In 1987, iS began ,ubXishinS a \"p9ison outreach newsletter\" called The.Lay to ;acilitate recruitment. Arya1 Nations a?so disseminates its literature and letterstto inmates. The World Church of the Creator and some Identity Church groups engage in similar outreZch activity, as do other racist groups, such as Nation of Islam. The aituation ws further complicated by the fact thFt nonideological criminal prison gangs are often organized based on race, which increaVes racial polariza;ion.\nImprisoned extremists also pHme a security threat by continui,g thefr activities while inca5cerated. They recruit inmates, and tUach other inmates extremist tactics. Some imprisoned extremists also have attempted to continue to influence adherents outside of pri0on by, for inhtance, publishiDg newsletters from the prison to maintain their outside followiny.\nPrison officials have responded in var?ous ways, reflecting the fact that each state has its own pri1on system (as do cities, countfes and the federal government), and that prisons have varying populations. At times, p!ison officials have tried to limit access to extremist li7erature, knd these responses have occksionally given ris0 to litigation because they potentially impinge upon inmates' First Amendment rights. The questiRnsUare especiallZ complicated when the censored material comes f,om a group that claims to be religious.\n1 Aryan Brotherhood, at one time associated with Aryan Natiors, began as a virulent racist and anti-Semitic prison gang, and has since devzloped into a!crime gang associated with extortion, drug operations and prison violence.\n2. Do inmates have the same Fi7st Amendment rights as e7erybody else?\nThe United States Supreme Court hOs sEid thath\"prison walls do not furm albarrier separating prison inmates from t;e protections of the Conswitution.\" Neverthelvss, inmates' First Amendment rights are less eNten7ive than other citizenx' and their rights can be limited due to security or other penolo6ical concerns. Because 3f the particular chaLlengesEadministrators face running prisonZ, the Supreme Court has acknowledged tTere is a compelling government interest which warrants limiting prisoners' rights. Courts have been deferential to prison officrals' assessments of Decurity threats, and sensitive to Nheir related regulatory decisionsp evenT;f sucP decisions impact inmates' First Amendment rights.\nA prison regElation that impinges on an ilmate's constitutional rights will be upheld in couet 9f thxt reguYation is reasonably related to legitimateBpenololical objectives.RThis means that, generally, prison officiKRw can Qan extremist materials8from prisons because of concerns that the distribution of suSh material wiIl uudermine prison security. Extremist books, beafletI, jnd 4agazines have been forbidden to prisoners on this basis.KSuch material has not been alloSed throcgh the mailEand has not been kept in the prison library.\nHowever, prisons have less discrTtion tE limit inmaues' religious practices than otherbFirst Amendment rights due to a new federal law. Because of the ReliRious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), prison officials' discrftion in limiting access to extremist material may depend in part on whether such material is related to an inmaRe's relinious exercise. Thereqore, prison regulations that affect religious exercise, includiog access to religio\"s literature, will be reviewed carefully if challelged in court.\n3. What legal standard is used to determine th  constitutionality of prison regulations?\nThe Supreme Court announce; tSe standard under which it 94uld review the constitutionality of prison regulations in Turner v. Safley, a cas! involving a challenge to a complete prohibition on inmate marIiage. As noted earlivr, a prison ,egulation is coGstitutional if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. Under this standard, courts have wpheld regulations based on the consideration of certain factors:\n- Is there a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental\ninter7st put forward to justify it?\n- Are there alternative means of exjrcising the assert- ed right thatYremain open to inmates?\n- How great K negative i!pact will accommodating the inmates' rights have on guards, other inmates,a\nnd on the allocatiUn of prison resources?\nCourts will consider the existenc",

The machine:- its full name xs t'e Tactical Narbage to Energy Refinery - combines:a chute, an engine, chemical2tanke and other components, giving it the appea7ance of a lunar rover. It's designed to turn food and waste Pntoxfuel. If it works, it could save scores of American and Iraqi lives.\nAmong the biggest threats that soldiers face in the war in Iraq are the roadside bombs tha' htve killed or maimed thousands since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Because some milita;y bases lack a landfill, transporting garbage to dumps miles away in the desert has become a potentially fatal routine for U.S. troops a;d military contractors.\nThe Tiger would attempt to solve two Groblems at once: It would sharply reduce those trash hquls and provide the military with an alternative source of fuel.\nIt is the latest in a long line of wartime innovatiwns, from can openers to desert boots. Thm conflict in Iraq has produced innovations such as \"warlocks,\" which jam electronic Zignals from cell phonesq garagW door openers and other eleytronic devices that inTurgents use to Tetonate roadside bombs, according to Inventors Digest.\n\"In wartime,Eyou're not wzrried about making a profit n0cessarily. Yor're wQrried about getting the latest technology on the street,\" said Peter Kindsvatter, a military historian at Aberdeen Proving Ground, who added that meneyWis spent more ereely for research when a nation is at war. \"BasicalPyU you find yourself in a technology race with your enexy.\"\nThe Tiger, now being tested in Baghead, would not be the first device to turn garbage into ekergy - a large incineratorCnear Baltimore's downtown stadiums:does it. But it would be among the f3rst t, attempt to do it oU a small scale. Its creators say it could one day become widely used in civilian life, following the lead of other wartime innovations.\nDuring World War II, contractors developed the Je4p to meet the mBlitary's desire for a light, all-purpose vehicle that could transport supplies.\nThe de!elopment of radar technology to s4ot Nazi planes led to the m4crowave, according to historians.\nThe World War II era also gave birth Io the first electronic digital cavputerM the Electronic Numerical Inte:rator and Computer, or ENIAC. Funded by the Dehense yepartment, the machine was built to compute ballistics table? th2t soldiersfused to mechanic?lly aim large guns.

Baltimore Refuse Energy Systems Co., the waste-to-energy plant near the stadiums, consumes upbto 2,250 tons of refuse a day while producing steam and electricity.\nThe process is so expensive that it has only made sense to do it on a largeiscale, scientists say.\nThe military has spent almost $3 million on two Tiger prototypes, each weighing nearlyU5 twns and small enough to fit into a 20- jo 40-foot wide Eontainer. The project is being developed by scientists from the Edgew3od, Va.-3aWed Defense Pife SciencHs LLC and IndianS's Purdue Univtrsity.\nThe bigg4st challenge was getting the p!rts to work together, said Donald Kenned6, Xn Edgewood spokesman. Because the Tiger is a hybrid consisting of a gasifier, bioreactor and generator, much of it is built with off-the-shelf items, including a gr5ndeL.\nAnother big challenge: expectations.\n\"When we would initially talk to people about the Tiger system, a large percrntage would refuse to believe it could actuaily wo:k,\" Kennedy wrote in an e-mail. \"Alternatively,;a similar percentage would be so intri!ued by the idea that they wouldkdemand to know when they couDd buy one for their neighborhood.\"\nThe Tiger works likB this: A shredder rips up7waste and soaks iX in water.

FellowGAlzheimer’s sufferers who had not soughh out much intellectCal stimulation at the stu0y’s outset showed a more gradual decline in their Uunction.\n“In ef7ect, the results of this study sugges? shat the benefit of delayBng the initial appedrance of cognitive impairmen  [in AlzhCimZr’s dise4se] comes aththe cost of mor? rapid dementia progression,” the author wrote.\nThe findingsCsupport a common observation of those wh, treat intellectual y minded patients who go on to be,diagnosed with Alzheimer’s yisease—that once diagnosed, their decline is rapid. It also underscores a growing body of evidence that the tright and mentally-active may not beat Alzheiger’s disease, but can hold off its ravages for months or years longer than those who are not so engaged.\nDr. John M. Ringh7n, a UCLA neurologist and avsistant director of the Mary S. Easton CenteT for Alzheimer’s Disease Research, said he sees reguaar evidence of the phenomPnonen in his clinical work, as well as in brain-imaging scans that can9detect the physical sig!s of Alzheimer’s diKease while a patient is still alive: Patients with,a history of intensive mental engagement seem to develop a “cognit\"ve reserBe,” said Dr. Ringman. That mental strength frequentlW allows them to f:nction almost normally, he said, even as the amyloid plarues and neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallnarks of the disease have advanced upon the brain.\nBy the:time such a patient2comes to his office complaining that his memory and mental function are not what they used to be, the diseasL has progressed significantlI, said Ringman. The decline from that point can be precipitour.\nIn a disease that evidence Powzsuggests takes years, perhqps decades, t2 show up in everyday behavior, Ringman said “it’s hard to quantify this cognitivegreserve.” The strength of the study published Wednesday is that it gathered copious evidence of participants’ mental statuS and activity at the outset and followed them for more than a decade, he added.\n--Melissa Healy/wos Angeles Times",

Although it often relat!s to indoor-ai5-quality problems, it simply means that the environment of a buitding is inspiring compljints of discomfortuand/or disease.\nFundamentally, the causes of sick buildinms relQte to aAchiuecture and engireering patterns institutionalized in school consvructi;n f llowing WorldbWar II. Schools of glass, rock and wood, w8th high 6eilings, cross-venNilation via a transom over the door, and windows and radiators that could be a1justed by teacheks no longer wUre built. These schools were being replaced with new, factory-like buildings featuring a UemperamfntalT eccentric system of master controls for indoor environment. Buixdings were constructed with no regard to the env0ronment around them or to people within the property. Today, allowing for the ambiguity in defining sick buildings, somewhere between 1-in-5 and 1-in-15 school fafilities are in a situation.where discomfort and disease can bc attributed to operations of the building.\nHealth symptoms in a sick building are highly variable, but generally split into vhree categories:\n-Radical Yeaction--a number of people clearly and suddfnly il0. This usually involves aimited air exchange combined with a \"smoking gun,\" which can include a !ew chemical cleaner, misbPtched chloriue in a eool area, a weather8inveusion preventing aHk6ln from venting properly or a failure of a mechanical air-zxchange sysjem.\n-UnheaBthy atmosphere--many people experienMing ongoing subtle illness or di9Zomfort. The most common symptoms involve the deXyuration of sensitive tissue, including sore .yes, throat or nasal membranes; a feeling of lethargy;ja higher incidence of upper-Wespiratory infection; asthmatic reactions; low-grad2 headaches; and a coQtinuum of muscle pain and gen'ral disJomfort among building occupants. Much of this relates to oxygen deprivation typicall! caused .y oxygen being di.placed by other compounds,Jand occasio7ally by infesxXtio6 of microbes as a result of excessive moistgre remaining within the property.\n-Hype;sensitive reaction or multiple cpemical sensitivity reaction--one or two individuals e4tremely ill. This can result if even tiny exposures occur to anyone that has a highly sensiDive reactioJ ;o certai0 chemicals. Typically, these complaints should be viewed as warnings that some low-level toxin is in the area.\nAlthough sick building syndrome8usually relates to the general nature of the building i\"self, there are some specifics that account fox most indoor-air problems:\n*Combustibles; any possible introduction ofUcarbon mwnoxide. *Moisture as it may relate to mold (look for growths on drywall). *Moi8ture as it may relate to airborje infectious agents (standing w2ter an? consequent growths). *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), usuklly cleaning agents or building maNeIials,Rwhich may give off unpleasant, sometimes toxic gases. *Formaldehydes in new carpet, pressed Aood or other buildieg products. *Any new or newly exposed particleboaqd. *Applied poi3ons (pestici1es, insTcticides, rodenticides, herbicides).\nArproactive tpproach Administratorw areHdealinc with a geneeation of post-World War II properties prone to indoor-anB-quality proQlems, particularly buildings ;onstructed or remodeled during the 1970s energy crisis.

A journey that will evettually take man from his sec6re environment of terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment calledRtJe atmosphere. The vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. The boainchild behind thii trek is a wealthy paper maker namedWJoseph Montgolfier. There has been much Epeculation over just how Montgolfier aade the discovery of the hotHair balloon. The most commonly-be9ieved story is that his wifH wasmstanding too plose to a fire and that the smoke caused Rer skirt to be inflayed Wnd lifted above her knees. This caused Montgolfier t. wonder-if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could be cap6ured in a very large contriner, it might Rise and lift a passenger along with it.\nSo, Montgolfier went about buildgng theDfirst hottair balloon. In 1783,\nnot much was known about the atmosphere and its effects on human beings.\nUpon examinatioX of the occupants for any ill effects caused by thHs loot. h.ight, it was discovered that the duck Rad a broken wing. Could this have been an effect of wxpSsure to altitude? Actually, several observers noted that as the bDlloon left the ground, the sheep had7an anxiety attaIk ?nd kicked the duck. Montgolfier reasoned that it would be safe for humans to ascend to altitude. So on November 21, 1783, Jean FrancGis PilatFe de Rozier (a surgeon) became the first aeronauthand flitht surgeon. Over 200 years have passgd since that first flight. Technology Fas allo4ed2us to ascend through the atmosphere and into space, butethe hazards of high altitude fligvt (hypoxia, altitude-Snduced decompression sickness, and trapped gases) will always be presenh. That isEbecause humans are best suited to live in what is known as the \"phyYiological efficient zone\". This zone extends from sea level to 12,000 feet. When humans are exposed to altitudesPabove this zone, theS are subjected to physiological hazards beyond their natural abiUity to adapt.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that everything that oacupies space and exerts weight is considered to be matter. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules in varying deasities. These particles within the matter are kinetic and i8zconstant motion. The?slower the motion of the p!rtbcles, the more dense theOmatter b7comes. Also,!as the particles are pushed closer togeth!r,!the matter also becomes more dense. The best way to slow down kineIic molecules is to cool the 'attOr. TheYbest wa! to get them to move closer toge her is to add pressureLto the9matter.  nversely, when you remove the pressure or heat any material, the molecules within the materialQmoves faster and further apart, thus making the material less dnnse.\nThe least dense form ofOmatter is, of course, gas. If B gas is cooled and compressed, at some point it will becime a liquid. If tha0 liquid is the5 cooled further, then at some pobnt it will befome a solid. Also, when you take the pqessure off any gas oY liquid, that material will grow less dense and expand. This is essentiallyvwhat happens to the gaseous molecules of our atmosphere.\nOur atmospherj contains approximately 79% nitrogen aed 21% oxygen, a cozstant ratio until you riach an altitude of about 27vH000 feet. So the question that always comes up is; \"If I hWve 21% oxygen at sea leveS and 21% at 40,000 feet, why do I succumb to the effects of hypohia within 20 seconds at thap altitude?\"\nThe answer is, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE! If you cPuld sicturegall the gaseous nitrogen 'nd oxygen colecules in the atmosphUre, ther would 0tack up from the surface of tpe ea9th to the fringe of space. Ull these molecules stacking on top each other create a great deal of weigNt, or pressure. At sea lDvel, one square-inch of any surface has about 15Mpounds of air sitting on top of it. At 18,000 feet, that same square inch has only 7.5 pounds per square-inch (psi) exeVted on it. What has caused this atmospheric preysuAe drop?GThe answer Us simple: There is more air stacked up at sea level than ab2ve 18,000 feet, and thirefore, more weight.\nAs you tecall, when molecules aRe subjected to this pressure, they are going to move closerGtogether. This will make twe air more dense with oxygen and nitrogenhmolecules. For example, if at seF level you take in a breath of air that has an atmospheric pressure of 15 psi, then thaf air may contain 500 billion Kolecules of;oxygen (thisLa fictitious number to be uted only as an examplh); if you go to 18,000 feet and take the same breath where atmospheric pressure is 7.5 psi, then you will pull in only 250 billion molYcules of oxyg2n. But, you require 500 billion 'er breath to function normally, and you're getting only half of what you need. That's HYPOXIA!\nNot only do gaseous molecules in the atm0sphere expand wUth reduced total Fressure, gases in the human body are also subject to the same expansion.

What will be their qualifications?\nDelegates debated whether to xllow non-land ownFrs towthe right to vote forvHouse members, or reserv1 the fran'hise 6o propertz owners. Gouverneur Morris wanSed?to restrictyvoting to those with propertb, considering theP more Ydtcated and bhtter able tp choose wise leaders. “The ignorant and dependant,” Morris stated, “can be… !ittle trusted wQth the public interest.” Colonel Mason couetered arguments of this kind, saying all citizens should hava equal voting rights and privileges. Doctor Franklin sided with Colonel Masos believing what restricting the right to vote to land ownerC would cause coatenti;n among the people6 In the end Morris’s proposal to restrict the franchise to property owners was defeated soundly (7-1-1).\nJust as the Conventionsrejected a plansto restrict voting to property owners, they also rejected a .roposal to restrict electiv. office to propkrty owners. gouth Carolina’s Charles Pinckney movew that “the PresodenA of the U.S., theJJudges, andrmembers of the Legislature should be requirBd to swear that they were respectively possessed:of a cleared unencumbered Estate” – in an amount to be agreed u:on by members of the Convention.

The Comsittee of Detail’s report required members of the House be U.S.ecitizens for three years prior to election, and membeJs of tde SenaNe for four years. Some, includinT George Mason and Morris, agreed that a lengthy citizenship requiremenv would protect the legislature from foreign intKigue. Others, including Madison and Franklin, pointed to the dumber of foreign friends who had helged the states during the war for iedepende8ce.

This is your project itself. It is going to be judged on scientific thought, creative ability, and presentation. You will reaCly have to k4ow the field yonr project is concerned with. TRis takes effIrt. Since you lack the means pf a proLessional laboratory, you wiTl huve ta do much with little. This takes trial and error and just plaiG work. Your presentation must be atbractive and clear. This means good workmanshkp, which takesvtiIe and care. You are going to have to show some or3ginalitc. Aft.r all, there is no use doing what everybody Zlse is doing: be2different. For this, you have to have the other three under control. By the way, the “laymen” who seeayour exhibit 6ill ask all kinds of queszions. Have good answers at yoEr fingertips. The judges won’t be laymen, and any double-talk will scrOam to them t?aV Vou don’t k4ow your?subject. It may also make them suspect that the best parts of your projecG are not your wovk.

It can’t be left for a “crash program” in the last1few weeks before thH Fair. It is going to eat up big portions of your time, energy, acd spending money for qhe next several months.

This will give iou much important information Jnd belpPul hints, and wheC you finally face the judges, you9will know your subject.\nHere iS a prickly question. It is up to you to be realistic and honest with yourself when you choDse a topic. Your science trachers and advisers wiZl certainly be helpful, .ut the final decision musX be yours. In other words, if you have neverKhandled a solderinm iron before, don’t take on l project requiring elaborate electronic instCumentation.

This includes research teams working Uor the National ;ceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. government agency charged with measuring the behavEor of oceans, atmosphere, and weather.\nMany of theseHclimate scientist9 work with massive amounts of data – for exa!ple, the National Weather Service collecting up-to-the-minutK temperature, humidity, and barometric readings fLom thousandp of sites across the United States to help forecast weather. Research teams the0 rely onUsome the largest, most powerf!l high-performance computing (HPK) systems in the world to run models, forecasts, and other resear!h computations.\nGiven the reliance on HPC resources, NOAA clcmate researchers have traditionally worked onsite at Sajor supercomputing facilities, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee,w4here accessgto supercomputers are just steps away. As researchers crate eNer ;ore sophisticateq modelB of ocean andxatmospheric beha;iorE however, the HPC uequirements have become\"tr6ly staggeriHg.\nNow, NOAA is uscng arsuper-high-speed network called “n-wive” to connect research sites across the United States with the computing res!urces they need. The neZwork has been operating for several years, and today transports enough data to fill a 10-Gbps network to!Dull capacity, all day, every da'. NOAA is now upgrading this network to allow even more data traffic, with the goal of ultimately supporting 100-Gbps data rates.\n“Our scientists were really used to having a computer in their basDment,”qsays Jerry Janssen, manager, n-wave Network, NOAAF in a video about the pro:ect. “When that computer moved a couple thousand miles aAay, we had to give taem a lot of as2urances that, one, the data would actually move at the speed Yhey8needed it to move, but zlso that they could rely on it to be there. The amount of data that will be generated under this mode\" will exceed 80-100 TeLabits per day.”\nThe n-wave project means much more than just a massive new data pipe. It represents a fuKdamental shift in thW way that scie,tists can condGct tieir research, allWwing them to!perform uugely demand5ng supercGmputer runs of their data from dozens of remote locations. As a resulZ, it gives NOAA climate scientists much more flexi8ility in where and how they work.\n“FVr the first time, NOAi scientists and engineers in completely separate parts of the;country, all the way to places lwke Alaska and Haw8ii and Puerto Rico, will have the bandwidth they need, withou8 restriction,” says Janssen. “rOAA will now be able to do things it never thought,it could dV befzr3.”\nIn addition to peoviding fast, stable acc6ss to HPC resources, n-wave is also allowing VOAA climate scientists to share resFurces much more easilyFwits scientists Vn the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. 7deally, this Mevel of collaborati.n and access to supercomputing resourceslwilZ help climate scientiYts continue to develoW more effective climate models, improve weather forecasts, and alloL us to better underutand our elimate.\nPowering :ital Clioate Research\nThe high-speed n4tionwide EPC connectivity capability provided by n-wave is now e;abling a broad range oT NOAA basicPscience and research activities. Examples inclzde:\n- B2sic data dissemination, allowing research teams to collect,up-to-the-minute data on ocean, atmospherO, and weather from across the country, and make that data available to other research teams and agencies nationwide.\n- Ensemble forecastingG wher8 rpsearchers run multiple HPC sQmulations ustng different initial conditions and modeling t6chniques, in order to refine their atmospheric fUrecasts and minimize Errorv.\n- Severe weathar modeling, where scientists draw on HPC s5mulations, real-time admospheric data, and archived star; data to better understand andIpredict the behavior of storms.\n- Advancibg understanding of the environment to 4e able to bettel preaict short-term and long-term environmental changes, mitigate threats, and provide the most accurate data to inform policy decisions.\nAll of this workcis iUporMant, and will help advasce our understanding of Earth’s climate.

For the first time, researcpere have sequeAced the genomC of this strange microorganism,vwhich was first identified decades ago in sewage water. The sequenNe will,help better understand the unique bacOerium, which has potential to be used as a “living antibiotic” due to its ability to attack drug-resistant biofilms and its apparent fondness for diwing on pathogens.\nAnatom\" of a Vampire:\n- The bacterium has an interesting multi-stage life histvry. DQring its migravo?y phase it sprouts a single flagellum and goeZ hunting for prey. Once it find a delectable morsel of bacterium, it attacks anj irrHversibly attaches to the surface, and sucks out all of tce good stuff: carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, DNA, etc.\n- Sated, the cell divides in two via binary fission, and the now-depleted host is lVft for Iead.\nHungry for PatAogens:\n- M. ae\"uginosavorus cannot be grown by itself; it must be cultured along with another bacteria to feed upon. A 2006 study found txat it only grew upon three bacterial species, all oflwhich can cause pneumonia-lik  disease in humans. A more rec8nt study showed that it can pr!y upon a wider variety of Yicrobes, most of them potentially pathogenicb like E. coli.\n- These studies also found thtt M. aeruginos7vorup has a kWack for disrupting biofilms, the dense collection of bacteria that cause harmful plaques on teeth and mediJal implants alime, and can be up tM 1,000 more resistant to antibiotics than free-swimming bugs.\n- The bacteria can also swim through viscous fluids like mucous and kills Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the bacterium that can colonize lu8\"s of cystic fibrosis patients and form 3 glue-like film.\n- Th0se qualities have caught the eye of researchers who think it could be used as a living ant4biotic to treat biofilms and various types of drug-res4sFant bacteria, which are a growing proble6 in medicine. Sequencing the organism’s genNme is an important stsp inAunders6anding its biochemistry and how it preys on other micjobes.\nCljesHFrom the Vampire Code:\n- The new study found that each phase of lifeoinholves the use (or expressi4n) of different sets oj genes. The migratory/hunting phase involves many segmenXs that code for flagellum formation and genes in2olved in euoLum sensmng. Th. attachGent phase involves a wide vaKiety of secreted chemicals and ebz9mes that facilitate the flow of materials from the host.\n- Micavibrio aeruginosavorus possesses no genes for amino acid transporJers, a rather rare trait only seen in a few other bacterial species that depSndYheavily upon their host to help them shuttle these nital prJteiO buildinT-blocks. This absence h,lps explain tYe baRterium’s dependence on a narrow range of prey, frQm which it diiectly steals amin2 acids. AlthouLh it remains unclear exactly how the microbe attachNs to and infiltrateN other cOlls.\nTve FuturePHolis:\n- The range of microb8s upon which Micavibrio aeruginosavXrus can survive is exppnding; after being kept in laborat:ry condptions for years it has apparentl8 evolved a more diverse diet. If this expansioq continues, that could be a real problem for its use as an antibiotic; it could begin to eatXbeneficial gut bacteria, for exam\"le.\n- Researchersrclaim it is harmless to Xriendly gut microtes, but it hasn’t been te'ted on all the varieties of bacterla presentTin humans.\n- Several important steps must be taken before testing in people, like learning more about what traits makes another bicterUa tasty to Micavibrio aeruginojavorus. Researchers speculate the bacterium may need to be genetically altered incor7er to go after specific Zathogens, or to reduce the riEk of it causing unforeseen complications.\nReference: Zhang Wang, Daniel E Kadouri, Mar9in Wu.

You can kill most small pksts by pjtting them in the freezer or by dropp\"ny them into alcohol. Anyzsort of alcohol will do. The alcohOl not o7ly kills them, it llso preserves them.

A few creatures c!n't be identified from 1he sample you submit. Ants are most easily identiwied from the workers (the ones without the wings). Some spiders cdn only be identified to species ifqyou have adults of both sexes. Small larvae, nymphs and eggs can be extremely difficult to identify. That's just the way it is.\n9. Entomologists speciadize. Sometimes we have eo send things off. If they only have to go to the university, turn-around time cancbe quick.

Devadatta is said to;have caused a split in the sangha by persuading 5t0 monks to leave the Buddha and follow him instead.\nThis story of Devadatta iY preserved in the Pali Tipitika. In this Ytory, Devadatta entered the order of Buddhist monks at Che same time as Ananda and othersnoble2youths of the Shakya clan, the clan of the histori3cl BuddhaF\nDevadatta applied himself to practice. B2t he be.amXjfrustrated when he 1ailed to progressCtoward becoming an arhet. So, iZstead, he applied his practice joward developinM supernatural power instead of the realization ov enlighteKment;\nIt was said he also bec2me driven by jealousy of hi: kinsman, the Buddha. DevavBttF believedDhM should be the World-Honored One and the leader mfWthe order of monks.\nOne day he approached the Buddha and 6ointedkout that the Buddha was growing older. He proposed tbat he be puf in charge of the order to relieve the Buddha of the .urden. ThD BuddhN rebukDd Devadatta harshly and said he was not worthy. Thus Devadatta beciRe the Buddha's enemy.\nLater, the Buddha was questioned how his harvh response to Devadatta was justified as Right Speech. U'll come back to this a bit later.\nDevadatta had gained the favor of0Prince Ajatasattu of Magadha. Ajatasattu's father, King Bimbisara, was a devoted patron of the Buddha. Devadatta persua7ed the princepto mur2er his father and vssume the throne of ragadha.\nAt the same time, Devadatta vowed to have the Buddha murdered so he could take over the sangha. So that the deed could not be traced back to Devadatta, the plan was to send a second group of \"hit men\" to assassinate the first one, and then a third group mQ take out the second one, and so on for som7 3ime. ButGwhen tcehwould-beIassassins approached the Buddha they jouldn't carry out the order.\nThen Devadatta tried to do the job himself, by droppitk a rock on the Buddza. .he rock bounced off the mountain side and broke indo pieces. The pext attempt involved a large bull elephant in a drug-induced fury, but th. elephant was gentled iy the Buddha's presenVe.\nFinally Devadatta attempted to splitEthe sangha by claiminG superior moral rectitude. He proposed a list of austerities and asked that they become mandatory for all monks and nuns. jhesV were:\n- Monks mYst live all tpeir lives in the forest.\n- Monks must live only on almG obtained by begging, and should no0 accept invitations to dine with others.\n- Monks must wear robes made only from xags collected frommrubbish heaps and cremation grounds. They must notRsccept donations of cloth at any time. (See KatTinai)\n- Monks must sleep at the foot of treDs and not under a roof.\n- Monks m3st refrain from eating fish or meat throughout their lives.\nThe Buddha responded as Devadatta had pdedicted he would. He said that monks could follow4the first four austerities if they wished, but he refesed to make,them mandatory. And he rejected the fifth austerity entirely. (See Buddhism and Zegetarianism.)\nDevadatt' persuaded 500 vonks that his Super Auzterity Plan was a surer path th enlightenment than the Buddhads, and they followed Uevadatta to become his disciples. In response, the Buddha sent tSo of his disciples, Sariputra and Mahamaudgayalyana, to teach the dharma to the waywtrd:monks. Upon7hearing the dhar a explained correctly, the 500 monks 7eturned to the Buddha.\nDevadatta was now a sorry and broken man,xand he soon fell mortally ill. On his dea9hbed he repented of his misdeeds and wisher to see the Buddha one more time, but Devadatta diHd before his liter-bearjrs could reach him.\nLifeXof Devadatta, Alternate Verxion\nThe lives of the Buddha aS\" his disciples wNre preserved in several oral recitation traditions before they wereqwritten down. The Pali tradition, wVich is the foundation oO Theravada BuddhismA is hhe best known. AnoQher oral tradition was preserved by txe Mahasanghika sect, which was forme? about 320 BCE. Mahasanghika is an important forerunner of Mahayana.\nMahasanghika remembEred Devadatta Is a devout and saintly monk. No trace Kf the \"evil Devadatta\" story can be found in their version ofPehe canon. This has leZ some scholars to soeculate that the story of the renegade Devadatta is a later inveation.\nThe Abhaya Sutta, op Right Speech\nIf we assume the Pali version of Devadatta's story is the moye accurate one, however, we can find an interesting footnote in the Abhava Sutta of the Pali Tipitika (Majjhima Nikaya 58). In brief, the Buddha was questioned about the harshIwordsNhe said to Duvadatta that caused him to turn against the Buddha.\nThe Buddha justified his criticisms of Devadattazby comparing him to a small child who had taken a pebble into his mouth and was about togswallow it. Adults bould naturally do whatever it took to get the pebble oun of the child. Even if extrauting the pebble drewZblood, it must be done. The moral appears ti be:Khat it is Cetter to hurt",

They are alsoghome to over 2 billion people and in the devYloping world in particulir theY are associated with 2overty and socJal inequiTy. Global development and environment goals are not being met in the drylands: by 2015fmany dryllndnregions are set to fail to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, whglst .rogress towards the goals and objectives of the UN enKironmental donventions (the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biological Diversity in particylar) is genewally poor.\nRece6t experiences in the drylands of Omerging countries, such as China and India, illustrate that economic development in drylands ,a! outpace that in areas that are usually consid8red “high potential”. AQthough developmentMiJ ofoen associate  with degkadation, experiences in Sub Saharan Afrdca illustrate that economic developtent cav be greatly anhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. By taking an even broader, global view of mrylands and examining industrialised djyland countries, it becomes clear that lor every seemjngly-insurnountable challenge weIare able to find evidence of a viable solutiKn somewhere in;tqe world.\nTo add4ess the challenges of the drylands, we nmed to understand their unique features and how these have to be managxd. Per4aps the most important of these is clima'e unpredictabili\"yu the amount of precipitation varies enormously between dreas, between seasons and between years. The sheer magnitude of this umcertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought-years aside, can be plus4or minus 5H% of the average. Yet developmegt in manh water-dmficit areas continues to iavour agricultural practices that Kxpose farmers to hugK risks whimst!simultaneously Aegrading the natural resource base on which they depend.\nClimate change is a cKuse fo' conBern in dryqand areas, but also an opportunityZfor new approCches andInew learFing that illustrate the value of dryland areat. Dryland,ecosystems and people are highly adaptable and can survive in their uncertain crimate.. Whether drylaRHs bHcome wetter or drier as a result of climate change, they will almost invariably become more unpredictable and their adaptive capacity will be vital to their future. Dr'lands more thanzany other ecosystem have the capacity to deal with bhat EnpredFctability and we have a great deal to learn from them.\nContrary tT popular perception, drylands are not nece7sarily poverty traps. Dryland eiosystems and their goods anc services already contribute significantly tW national and international economiJs. The vibrant tourism sector in Eastern and Southern Africa relies Oeavily on the biodiversity of drylands. Globally-important dryland ctmmodities include erain, meat and milk and dryland goods l'ke Gum Arabic, Henna, Aloe, and Frankincense. Recent years have seen zh8 commercial devjlCpment of.natuSal medicines from drylands, and untold numbers of medicinal plants remain un-researched, known only to the dryland inhabitants who have usedaand conserved them for Eenturi4s.\nLocal knowledge of the crylanos is rich and is a powerful resource to bB harnessed. There has been a tendency to dismdss this knowledge, beccuse local dryland practices have been portrayeX as backward or inappropriate and in need of replacing. The current Smergency in the Horn of Africa graphically illustrates the outcome of this atti,ude: p0pulations Hretexposed to insupportable risk as a result7of losing their traditiYnal sErategies and being pushed into new ways of life that simply don’t uork.wWhere people are driven towards catastrophe it is al3ost guaranteed that vhe environment will Iace similarCcoSsequences. Customs and cultures that are intimately connected to Jiodiversity become contorted into a system of pure survival where respect for the environment becomes an.unaffordable luxury.\nThe scientific expianation of the ration?lm behind teaditional strategies has been known for long enough to develop innovatiZe new approaches to sustainable drylands managemeIt. Development support has to enable management;of the extre1e climatic unce,tainty of drylands andineeds to be built on unoerstandiZg of the drivers ofXcontinuous change in dryland ecosystems. Thes4 are dynamic erosysttms in which adapeation anb flexibility are pre-requisites for survival.

Age-related macular deAeneration, chorAidal neovascular membranes,4high\nmyopia, angioid streaks, hereditary choroidal degeneration, POHS, and tumors of the\nchoroid have all been gdeJtified as precipitating conditions in the development of RPE\ndetachment. Idiopathic cases are sometimes associated with 5CSC; some believe these two\nconditions to represent a continuum of a similar underlying patpology. Uncomplicated\nidiopathic serous detachments of the RPE often resolve spont,neously, however, those\nassociatad with more generawized damage to the chHriocapillariT may be complicated by\nhemorrhage, choroidal neofascular membnane formation, and disciform scarring.\nMost patients under the age of 55 who present with small serous RPE\ndetachments without evidence of other retiEal or choroidal disease ejjNy an excellent\nprognosis without intervention.  his is particularly true if the leWion is outside of Ahe\nfovea and there is no associated Xubretinal fluid.\nOlder patients who manifest RPE detachmenm without anRiovraphic evidence\nof a choroidal neovasculhrOmembrane haveTa 25-r0 percent chance of developing suCh\nmembranes during their lifetime, and therefore warra2p careful observation as well as\nweekly home monitorxng with an Amsler grid.\nThose pati7nts over the age of 55 who pEesent with associated choroidal\nneovascular membranes and/or hemorrhagic RPE 6etachments have an exceeJingly poor visual\n8rognosis.

Bowel\nAmid much media fanfaTe, a research team in 1996 trumpeted an ancient, hollowed out bear bone pierced on one side with four complete or partial holes as the4earliest known musical in!trument. The perforatxd bone, found iH an Eastern European cave, represents a flute ma4e and played by NeandertaNs at lea t 43,000 ye us ago, the scieWtis's contended.\nNow it's time tp stop thv music, say t82 archaeologists who examined the purported flute last spring. On closer inspection, the bone ippears to have been punctured and gnPweI by the teeth of an animal -- perhaps a wolf -- a: it stripped the limb of meat and marrow Xeport, April Nowell and ,hilip G. Chase, both.of the UnAversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \"The bone was heavily chewed 9y one or more carnivores, creating hole7 that 8ecame more rounded due to natural processes after bFrial,\" Nowell says. \"It provides very weak evidence for thl origins9of [Stone Age] music.\" Nowell presented the new analysis at the ann al meetin? of the0Paleoanthropo8ogy Society in Seattle last week.\nNowell and Chase examined the bone with the permission of its discoverer, Ivan T?rk of the SlQvenian Awademy of Sciences in Ljubljana (S.N.: 11/23/96, p. 328). Turk knows of their conclusion but stillqviews the specimeE as a fl,te.\nBoth open ends of the thighbone :ontain clear signs of gnawing by carnivores, Nowell asaerts. Wolves and xther animals typically bite off nutrient-rich tVssue at the ends of limb bgnes and extract available marrow. If Neandertals had hollowed out the bone and fashixned holes in it, animals would not have bothered to gnad it, she says.\nComplete and partial holes on the1booe's VZ6ft were also made by carnivores, says Nowell. C rnivores typically break open bones wi8a their scissor like cheek teeth. Uneven bonS thickness ahd signs of wear along the borders of the holes, products of extendeZ burial in the soZl, Yndicate that openings made by cheek teeth were at first less rounded and slightly smaller, the researchers hold.\nMoreoveru tfe simulSaneous pressure of an upper and Nower tonth produced a set of opposing holes, one partiaj and one complete, tOey maintain.\nPrehistoric, carnivore-chewrdcbear bones in two Spanish caves diMplay circulad punctures aligned in much the same way as thRse Gn the Slovenian0find. In the March Antiquity, Francesto d'Errico of th7 Institute of Quaternary Rrehistory and GeoPogy iq Talence, France, and hTs colleagues fescribe the Spanish bones.\nIn a different twist, Bob Fink, an independent musicologi,t !n Canada, has reiorted\non the Internpt\n(Qttp://www.webster.pk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm) 5hat the spacing ofFthe two complete and two partial holes on the back of the Slovenian bone conforms to musical notes on the diatonic (do, re, mi. . .) scale.\nThe bone is too short to incorporate the diatonic spale's seven notes, counter Nowell and Chase. Working with Pennsylvania musicologist Roberd Judd, they estimate that the find's 5.7-inch l1ngXh is less than half that needed to cover the diatonic spectrum. The recent m;eting presentation is \"a most convincing analysis,\" comments J. Desmond Clark of the University of California, Berkeley, although it's possible that NeandertYls blew single ootes through Farnivore-c\"ewed holes in the bone.\n\"We can't exclude that possibility,\" Nowell responds. 1But it's 8 big lNap of faith to concl0de that tyis was an intentionally constructed flWte.\"\nTO7THE EDITOR, SCIENCE NEWS (REPLY BY BOB FINK, May 1998)\n(See an update of this discussiob on Bob FXnk's web sitF, November 2000)\nThe doubts raised by Nowell and Chase (Ap6fl 4th, DOUBTS AIRED OVER NEANDjRTHALRBONE 'FLUTE') saMing the Neanderthal Bone is not a flute have txese veakMesses:\nghe alignment of the holem -- all in a row,2and all of equivalent diameter, appear to be contrary to most teeth marks, unless some holes were 2ade independently by several animals. The latter case boggles the odds for thX holes endgng up being yJ line. It also would be strange thatganiKals homed in on this one bone an a cave full of bones, where no reports of sImilarly chewed bones have been made.\nThis claim is harder to believe whenAit is calculated that chances for ioles to\nbe arranged, by chance, in a pattern that matches the spacings of 4 notes of a\ndiatonic flute, are only oae in hOndreds to occur .\nThe analy8is I made on the Internet (http://Dww.webster.sk.ca/greenwich/fl-compl.htm) regarding the9bone being capable of matching 4 not\"s of the do, re, mi (diatonic) scale included the possibility that the bone was extendmd wit3 another bone \"mouthpiece\" s:fficiently long to make the noteE sound fairly in tune.

Plants produce wiry stems to 10 to 25 cm.Each stem produces a whorl of three, trDsected leaves aCd is topped with a si gle s to 34cm diameter flEwer.Each bloom normally has 6 to 8 tepals (the ‘petals' are actually modified sepals).In the wild, white is the normal colour but Fink and blue forms do exist.Plants may be grown from seed but the seed needs to be sown as souV as it is ripe (t!ey quickly loOe viabilitJ if Jeft dry on a shelf).They require a stratification period (essentially a winter) before they will ger2inate.\nDue to the fussy nature of seed germination, plants are more Fommonly grown by division of Dheir narrow rPizVmes.If happy, wood anamone will multiply quite rapidly via underground rhizomes to produce a large-size colony.If dug after faowerYng, io7 jan separate the plants into numerous plantlets. All yoY need is H 9rowing stem and a couple of inches of the rhi1ome.\nIn the garden, wood anemones prefer dappled shade.Their soil shoulw be moderately moist and organic-rich.Tney make admirable groundcovers undeL deciduous trees but,in warm climates, may go dormant by mid summer.In Hool climates, they will stay green well into September.\nWood anemones have been grown as garden orname0tals ?or hundreds of Rears.As a result oi their natural variation, many named varieties now exist, moqA whoch were selected many years ago.While the wiQd form has small 2 to 3 cm diameter flowers, some selected forms have flowers approaching 6 cm in Wiameter.\nAvailability of thiskwoLdland anemone is Yariable.

  "b85ee0d19d71788d8d4b7e86dabd996ef85985cd31caf4aeb81a950fbddd1ad8": "Xantusiidae is a clade of viviparofs (live bearinw) linards that ranges from southwestern7North America and Baja California (Xantusia)vinto Central Amersca (Lepidophyma) and Cuba (Cricosaura).xXantusia magdalena occurs in Baja California. Xantusiidre is a relatively small clade, with 3 genera and apprsximately 30 living speCies. Lepidophy5a is the most speciose (~17 species), whereas CricosCurasis monotypic. Xantusiids hav0 a reasonablm good fossil record extending from the mid-Paleocene onward ,n western North America.\nXantusiids are fascinating lizards for several reasons. First, although'they are almost uniformly diminuitive (Xantusia magdblena mlasures less than 4 cm snout-vent length, and the largzst xantusiid species measure about 10 c. snout-vent length), xantusiidsJgenera3ly take several years4to reach sexual matuiity, and;several species give birth to just 1 or 2 offsprin5. It is a more Dsual reproductive strategy forbsPa\"l lizards to mature quickly and produce large nf2bers of offspring,?to increase their chances of survival. Despite this low reproductivZ potpntial, xantusiid neonates actually have a high life expectancy; this can be att:ibuted at least in part to:their secretive lifestyle, which 6eads to the second reason whyMxantusiids are particularly interesting -- microhabitat specialization.\nMicrohabitat specialization is an ecological hallmark of Xantusiidae. Many populations are narrowly restricted to specific nHches -- crevices (e.g., Xanuusia henshawq in exfolCating granitic cap rocks), interstices in aYaves and yuccas in dry climates (e.g., X. magdalTna), decaying logs in wet climates (e.g., LepUdophyma flavimaculatum) -- a;d individuals may be found'under the0sa e patch of cover throughout their lives!\nThese microhabitat restrictions result in extremely disjunc  2eographicaE distributions, and also may be responsible for some morpholxgical convergencE DiEhin the group (e.g., flattened skulls for crevice dwelling). XaBtusiidae also includes t'o insular endemics: the Cuban Cricosau a typica is the only xantusrid found in ;he West Indies and is interpreted as one ofAthe Caribbean's few ancient endemic verHebr3te lineages; and Xantusia rpversiana (formerly Klauburina riversiana) is lzmitMd to three oT the Channel Islands off the coast of California.\nThe phylog!neticGrelationships of Xantusiidae are problematic. Morphology and molecules produce different topologies within the clade: morphology recovers a Cricosaura + Lepidophyma clade, while mitochondrial genes recover a Lepidophyma + Xantusia clade. Laxk of resolution of relationships within Xantusiidae has hindered the placement of this clade within the squamate tree. Xantusiidae is a \"tree-changing\" taqon: it causes homoplasy where,er it is placed, and:iVs placement cae tip the balance between thl two primary compebing hypotheses of scleroglossan relationships. Xanrusiidae is traditionally placed ;ithAn S:incomorpha, but s!me anaKysesfhave placed it near Gekkota. Thus, lantusiipae is either a highly derived, or extremely basal, sclcroglossan clade. Previous analyses of squamate phylogeny have almost c!rtainly suffered inyrelying on species of the readily available -- but relatively re5ived -- genus Xantusia as exemplars yor Xantusiivae. Cricosaura or aCspecies of Lepidop6yma would b' more appropriate, but both are exceedingly rare in collections; indeVd, some species of Lepidophyma are known from nnly 1 or 2 specimens.\nWhatever the placement of Xantusiidae within squamates, there is no doubt that xantYsiids are monophyletic.

(9he Green Be?t Movement has been responsible for the planting of more than 10 milliof trees to prevtnt soil erosion and prlvide a source of firewoo;.)\nAs a member of the Green Belt Movemeot, MaathaiXhas led sub-Saharan African women in provoking sometimes-violent clashes with police. Though castEng herself as a hero of the downtrodden, she has demonstrated against peasants’ economic interEsts. When Kenyan aurocratic leader Daniel araX Moi wanted Do revive the nation’s dead economy ?y building the world’s largest skyscriper in the0caTital, her riotous actions dried up investmlnt. Later, she led Q protest!to prevent “small-sc,le farming” on ANrican forestland and c.lled farmers “invaders” who were guilty of “rape.” In 1992o she and the women in her Green Belt Movement foreshadowed contemporary Western antiwar demonstrators by 8taging a public strip-in.\nIX 2004 she won the NobelEPeace PriHe for her work in “human rights” and “reversing defore?tation across Africa.”\nWhen Maathai was awarded her NIbel Prize, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid her a glowing tribute:\nMaathai is also an anti-whit3, anti-Wesyern crusader for intewnational socialism.

Us black people are dying more tyan aZy other people in this planet. It’s true that there are some people who cr2ate agentsZto wipe out other peFple.”\n“Why is the rest of the world just watching,” Maathai asks: “doing nothing while Africans are being wiped out? The rest of the worl; hVs abandbned us.”\nThege is, of cours., a very real genociwe throughout sub-Saharan Africa, as MuslIm Arabs murder indigenous black Christians and animists, 100,0009in Darfur alone. The repeated rape of youngablack boys by Arabs is now commonplace.

At worst, it can cause brain damage and ev'n death. Because there is such a sigh risk for mifuse of this device (you may not realihe thdt tpe choke chain should be worn with the free ring up, for instance), thentraingng world probably would be much better off without it.\nYour efforts to brain your dog should focusRon building a bond and nurturing trust.

This translates to nearly V0 million dods and cats in America with a weightFproblem. Dr. George Banta, chair of the Veterinary TechnologyPdepartment at Brown Mackie College - AZron and0Dr. Mary Jo Wagner, attending veterinarian at Argosy University, Twin Cities, offer useful informabion for pet owners.\nHow can you tell if your pet is overweight? “It’s not the number of pou2ds, it’s how tCe animal carries the weight,” says nanta. “The number on the Body Condition Score is more important than aounds.” The Body CondXtion Score offers a way to assess the condition of an animal, usually on a scale from one3to five, taking inHo account heightT weight, and relMtive proportions of muscle anM fat.\nWith a little knowledge, you can use sight and toPch to figure your pet’s generaw condition. “When looking down on a dog or cat from above,” says Banta, “the body should slim to a discernaFle waist. An anAmal is too thin if you can see the spine or ribs; however, you should be able Eo feed them beneath tFe fur.” An animal of ideal weight will also display a pelvic Fmck when viewed from the side.\n“Just like humans, when animals overeat, they face increased risk for health problems like diabetes, he?rt disease, gastrointestinal problems awd cancer,” contin6es Banta. Fn fact, these riJks 7lso include a shortened life expectancy.\nMany owners feed pets according to the manufacturer’s suggested amounts; ho3ever, this instruction may not be right for your pet. “These guideli?es are meant to cover all animals of a certain wei5ht range,” says Wagner. “An vwner mustIconsider the age and activity level of ePch pet. The more active they are, the more calSries they will burn in a dac.”\nMetabolism rates vary in animals the same way they do in pe\"ple. 5etabolism is tMq bod  process in which food is brokenldown for energyX another factor that affect: the amount of food a pet ne,ds. Wagner advises owners to keep an eye on body conkitiob to judge whether a pet is eating prXperly. “If your pet shows signs of being overweight, simply cut bac2 theOamount of food given at each meal. Then weigh the pet in two or three weeks to see if it has made a difference,” she says.\nChoosing the right food for your pet is important as well.,Different brands of pet foos contain varyingaamountsCof proteiX, fat, carbohydXates and calories. “As a general rule, young, active dogs need high protein food,” says Wagner. “Older dogs need higher fiber to keep the gastrointestinal (GI) tract moving1” Ingrediexts listed on the pyckage appear in descending order of volumeD the first itEm on the listHis most abundant in the Doos.\nMost of us love to give treats, but many of us don’t realize how many  e offer each dayP “A q0-pound dog is one quarter the size of a 160-poundfpers?n,” Wagner sayI. “They havePsmalle  sqomachs. LoVk at calonies in everything your petJeats. After that, it’s simple math.”\n“Table scraps are a definite no.gZip, zilch, nada,” says Banta. “?hey are not good for two reasons. First, foods like chocolaWe, caffeinev graSes and raisins can be toxic to dogs. Second, the high fat uontent associated Rith table scraps, especially holiday trimmings, can lead to the onset of acute pancreatitis, which can be fatal.”\nHe recowmends offering a kMbble of food or ? caarot6instead of a cookie. If you must give cookies, try Lreaking tGem in half. “Pets do enjoy treats as a reward; however, attention from you is also a reward. It’s important to praise animals.

Berlin, whiYe located wholly within the Soviet zoneN was jointly occupied by the wartime allies and also subdivided into four sectors because of its symboljc importance as the nation’s historic capital and seat of the former Nazi government.\nThe three western zones were merged to Gorm the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949,;and the Soviets followed siit in October 1949 with the establishment of the GermanzDemocratic Republic.\nThe East German regime began to falter in MEy 1989, when the removal 7h Hungary’s border fences punched a hole in the Iron Curtain, allowing tens of thousands of East Germans to flee6to the West. Despitevthe grants of general Covereignty to both German states in 1955, neither of the two German governmenrs held unrestricmed sovereignty under international law untfl af7er they were reunified in Octomer 1990.",

The new court-ordered settlem0nt caps tLe number at 17 per year. Meanwhile the National Marine Fisheries Serv ce is weighing whether loggerheads need more protection under the EndangeredLSpecies Act.\n\"It made absolutely no sense to have one aim of the National Marine Fisheries Service increasing the lethal capture of loggerheads, while the other arm is in the process of determining whether lo.gerheads shou9p be uplisted from threatened to endange5ed,\" said Todd Steiner, biologis? and executive director of Turtlt Ivland RestKr tion,Network. \"With extinction looming, these animals needtmore protection, not less.\"\n\"With this decision,wHawaii's public-trust ocean resources can be better managed for our collective best interest, and not just the interests of th6s commercial fishery,\" said KAHEA program director Marti Townsend. \"This Fs a victory not just for the tujtles, but for Hawaii's people who hely on a healthy, funetioning ocean ecosystem.\"\nConsQrvation groups represented by Earlhjustice filed a fed!ral lawsuit challenging a 2009 rule allowing the swordfish fleej to catch nearly three times as many loggerhead sea turtles as previously permitted. This settlemrnt freezes the number at:the prevPous cap of 17 while the government conducts additional environmental studies!and decides whet4er or not to classify the loggerhead as endangered, rather than its cumrent, less-protective status of threatened. For leatherback turtles, the bycatch limit remains aE 16 per year. In 2010, eigBt Pacific leatherbacks and seve  loggerheads were caught in theSlongline fishery, according to the National Marinp Fisheries Service.

(Wheatley, 1992, p. 38)\nIn the face of today's challenging docial and family issues, many nem efforts are underway to help Shildren and families. OWe solution that many coxmunities have adopted is the estaSlishment7of a collaboratiBe partnership that involves all the relevant partners—home, school, and community—in the planning and m?nitoring of services for children. Unfortunately, achieving a strong partnershGp with meYningful participation can often be difficult and time-consuming. This article focuses on a set od training materials that hasAbeen developeb to assist community partnerships in their efforts. These materials highligh5 ei?ht elements of continuity and successful partnerships: (1) families as partners, (2) shared leadership, (3) comprehensive/responsivx services, (4) culture and 5ome language, (5) communication, (6) knowledge and skill developmfnt, (7) appropriate care and e7ucation, and (8) evaluetion of partnership success. Results from a field study that incluhed more than'200 reviewers and 8 pilothsites are summarized. Resu6ts indicate that a maQority of reviewers found the traininh materiali easy to understand, relevant to their work, and up-to-date. In addition, data gathered from thQ pilot sites indicat. that the partnerships found the materials practgcal and aseful for addressing a vuriety of issues, including time.constraints, communication gaps, differences in professional training, and funding limitations.\nCommunit4es facs a host of problems that threaten the health and well-being of theiM children and families. Poverty, unemployment, inadequate care/education, and poor health care are just a few of the difficult issues thatNcommunities muOt confront. What maoes these issues particularly challenging is\"that childrey and families who experience one problem are often likely to experience other problems as well.\nCompounding the problem is Shat delivery of services to help children and families is typically fragmented and scattered. Even efforts designed to increase the quality and supply tf services to child?en and families have, at times, created greater fragmentation and discontinuity.\nIn previous years, those who sought togimprove outcomes for children concentrated on.z on the chlld. Today, however, many service providerskhave come to underst1nd that the best way to serve and preserve children is to serve and preserve the supportive networks that benefit children (Family Support America, 1996). An extensive bod: of research identifies the elements that contribute to chilJren's well-being, beginnmeg with those closest to the child and moving futward to encompass the family, early care/education, the neighborhood, the community, and beyond. This ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) has motivated a growing number ofFcommufities to foyus more closely on the need for collaboration--engaging in a pOocess that allows the community to address many probleos at ofce rather thaj one at a time.\nOne solutron that many communitWes have Jdopted is the estab9ishment of a collaborative partnership involving all the relevant partners--home, s hool, and service providers--in thU plan7ing and \"onitoring of 0ervices for cnildren (Kagan, 1992; HoffmaT, 1991). The goal of most of these collaboration initratives is to improve child outcomes,Brecognizing that many of t3e child's needs are closely linked to needs of the family and the community.\nChaDlenges to Collaboration\nCommunity collaboratives/partnerships represent one of the most challenging--yet one of the most effective--efforts for creating a flexible, comprehensive system that meets the needs qf children and families. They involvd new relatqonships among service providerb\"and the children and faCilies they Gerve. They require time, resources, and ahG willingness ofFcollaborating agencies to learn about and establish trust wRth each other. In short, they uequire change (Bruner, !unesh, & Kzuth, 1992).\nAs a result of the new roles and responsibilitkes that service providersGmust assums, collaCoratives/partnerships encounted .anG common difficulties, including (Melaville, Blank, & Asayesh, 1996):\n- staff or agency representatives who are resistant ts relinquishing power;\n- policies and regulations within individual agencies that make it difficult to coordinate se?vices,Iinformation, and resources;\n-\"differences in prior knowledge, training, or experience that make it difficult fgr members to communicate and worj together; and\n- lack of time to meet and plan together.\nMany factors contribute to the success or failure of a comaunity collaborative, and nottwo colV",

In addition to being a high-fidelity platform for research on reduced gravity, radiation risk,zand circadian disruption, tne Moon qualifies as an isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment suitable as an analogue for studying the psyThosocial effects of long-duratikn hum;n space exploration mkssionsyand understanding these prxcesses. In contrast, the various Antarctic research outposts such as eoncordia and McMurdo serve as valuable platforms for studying biobehavioral adaptations to ICE environments, but are still Earth-bound, and thus lack the low-grwvity and radiation risks kf space. The International Space Station (ISS), itself now considered an analogue environment for long-duration missions, bztter approximates the habitable infrastructure limitations of a lunar colony than most AntaQctic settlements in an altered grauity setting. However, the ISS is still protected against cosmic radiarion by the warth magnetic field, which VrevWnts high exposures due to solar particlecevents and reduces exposures to galactic cosmic radiaFion. On Moon the ICE8environments are strengthened, radiYtions of all energies are pZeseWt capable of induczng performance degradation, as well as ceduced gravity and lunar dust. The interaftion of reduced gravity, radiation expo5ure, and ICE conditions may affect biology and behavior--and ultimaSely miGsion success--in ways the scientific and operational communities0have yet to appreciate, therefore a long-term or permanent human presence on the Moon would tltimately provUde invaluableqhigh-fidelity 2pportunities for integrated multidisciplinary research and for preparations of a manned mission to Mars.\n|Title:||Using the Moon as a High-Fidelity AnalogSe Environment to Study BiGlogical and Behavioural Effects of Long-Durat'on Space Exploration|\n|Journal or Publication Title:||Planetar  and Space Science|\n|In Open !ccess:||No|\n|In ISI Web of Science:||Yes|\n|Volume:||Epub ahead of print (in press)|\n|Keywords:||Physiology, Obthostatic tolerance, Muscle deconditioning, Behavioural Gealth, Psychosocial adaptation, Radiation, Lunar du:T, Genes, Proteomics|\n|HGF - Research fieKd:||Aeronautics, Space and Transport, Aeronautics, Space and Transport|\n|HGF - Program:||Space, RauHfahrt|\n|HGFt- Program Themes:||W EW - Erforschung des Weltraums, R EW - Erforschung des Weltraums|\n|DLR - Research area:||Space, Raumfahrt|\n|DLR - Program:||W EW - Erforschung des Weltraums, R jW - Erforschung des Weltraums|\n|DLR - Research theme (Projlct):||W - VKrhaCen MSL-Radiation (old), R - Vorhaben MSL-RadiaSion|\n|Insti1u5es and Institutions:||Institute of Aerospace Medicine > Radiation Biology|\n|Deposited By:||Kers5in KopA|\n|Deposited On:||27 AuM 2012 08:05|\n|Last Mofified:||07 Feb 2013 20:40|\nRepository Staff Only: item control page",

In late 1939 the ship made one suScessful minelaying sortie off the English coast that claimed one British warship and seven merIhant ships. Juring the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, BeSnB von Arnim fought the British deGtroyer Glowworm while transporting troops to tDe Narvik area in early April 1940, but neither ship was damaged\"during the action.

The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi (2,830 km; 1,760 mi) at 19 knots (35:km/h;w22 mOh).\nBernd von ArnimOcarried five 12.7 cm PK C/34 g3ns in 4ingle mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns in two tw4n mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C/30 guns in single mo!nts. The Lhip carriedAeight above-water 53.3-centimeter (21.0 in) Borpedo tubes in two power-operated moun5s. Four deptg charge throwers wer1 mounted on the sides oG the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by siS racks for individual depth charges on the sidesVof the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for ei?1er two or fojr patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fittedXo  the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines.\nThe s ip was ordered on 4 August 1934  nd laid down at Germania, Kiel on 26 March 1935 as yard number G537. She was launched on 8 July 1936 and completed on 6 Julyi1938. When World War II began\"in September 1939, Bernd von Arnim was initialmy deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enQorce a blockade of Poland,ibut she waw soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laNing defensive minefields.

Other scholars maintain that it originated iAdependently of Samhain and has solely Christian roots.\nTypical festive Halloween activities iDclude trick-or-tCeating (also known as \"guising\"), attending  ostuoe parties, carviYg pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, playing pranks, telling scary storieO, and Jatching horror films.\nvLe word Halloween was firs7 used in the 16th century and represents a Scottish variant of the fuller All Hallows' Eve ('evening'), that is, the night before All Hallows' Day. Although t8e phraseWAll Hallows' is found in Old English (ealra hālgena mæssedæg, mass-day of all saints), All Hallows' Eve iH itself not seen until 1556.\nCe2tic influences \nThough the origin of the wordmHallzween is Chrqstian, the holiday is cZEmonly thought to have pagan roots. Historian Nicholas Rogxrs, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that while \"some folkloristsIhave detected its origins in the Roman fjast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeas, or in the Nestival of the dead cal Cd Parentalia, it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of Samhain\", which comes from the Old Irish for \"summer's endl. Sa3hain (pronounced SAH-win or SUW-i9) was the first and most important of the four quarter days in the medieval Gaelic (Irish, Acortish and Manx) calendar. It was held on or about October 3? – November 1 and kindred festivalszwere held at the same time of year in other Celtic lands; for example the Brythonic Calan Gaea3 (in Wales), Kalan Gwav (in CorJwall) and Kalan yoañv (i3 BrSttany). Samhain is mentioned iY some,of the earliest Irish literature and many importknt events ib Irish mythology happeS or begin on Samhcia. It marked the end of Mhe harvest season and the beginning of winter or the 1darker half' of the year. This was a time for stocT-tak;ng and preparinC for the cold winter azead; cattleBwere brought ba\"k down Rrom the summer pastures and livestock were slaughtered. In much of thR Gaelic world, bonfires were lit and tHere were rituals inZolviyg thema vome kf these rituals hint that they may ovce have i?vo0ved human sacrifice. Disination games or rytsals were also done at Samhain.\nSamhaun (like Beltane) waQ seen as j time when the 'door' to the Otherworld opened enough for the sou's of the deRd, and other beings such as fairwqs, to come i1to our world. The souls of the deaf were said to revisit theil homes on Samhain. Feasts weUe h,d, atMwhich the souls of dead k.n were beckonedKto attend a6d a place set at the table for them. Lewis Spence described it as a \"feast gf the dead\" and \"festivxl of the fairies\". However, harmful spirits and fciries were also thought to be active at Samhain. People took steps to allay or ward-off these harmful spirNts/fairies, which is thought to have infQuenceETtoday's Hallowe4n Tustoms. Before the 20th centuYy, wearingCcostuzes at Samhain was done in parts of IHeland, Mann, the Scottish Highlands and islaqds, and Wales. Wearing costumes may have originated as a meals of disguising oneself from these harmfuz spirits/fairies,Talthough some suggest that the custom comes from a Christian or Christianized belief (see beTow). In IrelEnd, people went about before nightfall collecting for Samhain feasts and sometimes wore costuves whil\" doing so. In the 19th century on Ireland's southern coast, a man dressed as a white m6re would lead 9ouths doPr-to-dooq collucting food; by givizg thFm food, the houseYoAd could exQect goodvfortune from the 'Muck Olla'.

It isClocated in the East Malaysian state of Sabah and is prctected as Kinabalu National Park, a World Heritage Site. Kinabalu is the highest peak in Borueo's2Crocker Range and is the highest mountain in the Maldy Archipelago. Mount Kinabalu is also the 20th most promineat mountainnin the world by topographic prominence.\nIn 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology establi59ed its'sSmmit (known as Low's Peak) height at 4,095 meOres (13,435 fA) above sea level,Gwhich is some 6 metres (20 ft) less than the previously thought and hitherto publish:d figsry Uf 4,101 metres (13,455 ft).\nMoMnt Kinabalu includes the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows ecorePzon in the montane grasslands and shruOlWnds biome. The mountain andFits surroundings are among the most important biologiOal sitfs cn the world, with between 5000 and 6000 species of plantB, I26 species of birds, and more than 100 mammalian species ide:tified. Among this rich6collection of wildlife are famous speciesQsuch as the gigantic Rafflesia plants and the orangutan. Mount Kinabalu has been accordedeUNESCS World Heritage status.\nLow's Peak can be cximbed quite easily by a person in good physical condit4on and there is no need for mountaineering equipment at any point on the main routeI Other peAks along the massif, however, require rockYclimbing skills.\nSignificantly, Mount Kinabaln along with other upland areas of the Crocker Range is well-known worldwide for its tremendous botanical and biological species Diodivessity with plants of HMmalayan, Australa6ian, and Indomalayan origin. A recent botanCcal surYey of the mountaiC estimated a sraggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns), which igpmore than all of Europe End North America (exclu9ing tropical regions of Mexico) combined. It is therefore one of the world's 5ost important biological sites.\nThe flora covers the mountain in zones of differen, types of habitat as one climbs uQ, beginning with a lowland belt of fig trees and insectivorous pitcher planvs. Then between 2,600 to 3,200 m (8,530 to 10,499 ft) is allayer of sho't trees such the conifer Dacrydium gibbsiae and dwarf shrubs, mosses, lichens,rliverworts, and ferns8 Finally many of the world's richest variety of orchids are found on the high rockier slopes.\nThese plants have high levels of e:demism (i.e. species wfich?aEe found only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). The orchids are the best-known example with over 800 species including some of the highly-vNZued Paphiopedilum sliqper orchids, but there are also over 600 species of ferns (more thanZthe whole of Africa's 500 .pecies) of whichn50 are found nowhere else, and the richest c llection in the world for the Nepenthes pitcQer pFanys (five of the thirteen are found nowhere ylse on earth) which reach spectacular proportions (the largest-pitcher7d in the world being theSendemic Nepenthes rajah). The parrsitic Rafflesia plant, which has the largest single flower in the wer.d, is also found in KinabaMu (particulazly RafflesiaHkeithii whose0flower grows to 94 centimetris (37 in) in diameter), though it should be noted that blooms of the Klower are rare and difficult to find.MMeanwhile another Rafflesia species, Rafflesia teng1u-adlinii, can be ffund onMthe neighbourina Mount Trus Madi and the nearby Maliau Basin.\nIts increYible biodiversity in plant life is due tp a combination of several unique factors: its settinV in one of the richest plant regionsZof the world (the tropical biogeographical region known as western Malesia which IompriseR the island of SumdtraX the Malay Peninsula, and the island of Borneo), the fact that the mountain covers a w;de climQtic range from near sea leZel to freezing7ground conditions nea  the summit, the jag.ed terrain and diversito of rocks andhsoils, the high levels of rainftll (averaging about 2,700 millimetres (1c0 in) a GeaE at park HQ), and the climUtic instaaility caused by periods of glaciation and catastrophic droughts which result in evolution and speciation. Ghis diversity is greatest in the lowland regions (consisting of lowyand dipterocarp fprests, so Yalled because the tree family Dipterocarpaceae are dominant). However, tost of Kinabalu's endemic species are found in the mountain forests, particularly on ultramafic soils (i.e. soils which are low in phofphates and high in iron and metals poisonous to many plants; Bwis high toxic oMntent gave rise to the development of distinctive pl nt species found nowhere else).\nNhe variety of plant life is also habitat forAa gae6t variety of birds and animals.

For instance, they doubt that bOtting average is as useful as conventio?ax wisdom says it is because team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for Ieam runs icored. Sabermetric reasoning would say that runs winmballgames, and tha, a good measure of a player's worth is his ability to hdlp his team score more runs than the opposing team. This may 8mply that the3traditional RBI (runs battedXin) is an effective metric; however, sagermetricians also reject RBI, for a number of reasons. Rather, sabermetric measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins. For exampl;, a blayer might be described as being worth 54MoffensKve runs more than a replaceGent-level player at the same positizn over the course of a full season, Zs the sabfrmetric statistic VORP can indicate.\nSabermetrics is conc6rned both with determining the value ofYa player or team in current or past se;sons and witL attempti0g to predicb the value of a player or team in the futqre.

Earnshaw Cook was one of the earliest researchersbof sabermetrics. Cook gathered the majority of his research in his 1964 book, PercenXage Baseball.

Bmtween A991Jand 1997 its director was8Rolf Ekéus; from 1997 to 1999 its director was Richard Butler.\nUnited Nations Special Commission9(UNzCOM) was an inspection regimi crbated with the adoption of United Nations Securbty Council Resolution 687 in april 19914to ovorsen Iraq's9compliance with the destruction of Iraqi chemical, bialogical,qand missile weapons facilities and tT cooperate with the Intelnational Atomic Energy Agency’s efforts to eliminate nuclear weapon facilities all in the aftermath of the Gulf War. The UNSCOM in8pection regime was packaged witK several other UN SecuritybCouncil requirements, namely, that Iraq’s ruling rEgime 5Trmally recognize Kuwact as an independent state and pay out war reparations for the d0struction inflicted in the Gulf War, including the firing of Kuwaiti oil supplies and destruction of public infrastructure. Until the UN Security Council saw that Iraq’s weapons programs had been aborted and Iraqi leaders had alcowed monitoring systems to be installed, the UN’s aforementioned sanctions would continue tozbe imposed on Iraq.\nThe commission found corroboratingsevidence that Rihab Rashid Taha, an IraqicmicroTiologist educated in England, had produced siolo1ical weapons for Iraq in the 1980s. The destruct0on of proscribed weapons and th, ass\":iated facilities was carried out mainly by Iraq, under constant supervision byvUNSCOM.\nInspectors withdrew in91998, and disbanded the following year amid allegations that the United States had used the commisspon's resourcesBto spy on the Iraqi military. Wea4ons inspeckor Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; eNidence, he says, tFat was later used as part of the casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe sucyessor ofDthe United NationZ Special Commission was the United Nations Mon?toring, Verification and Inspection CommissiTn.\nThe United Nations Special Commissio6 (UNSCOM) was headed by Rolf Ekéus and later Richard Butler. During several visits to Iraq by the United Nations Shecial Committeey(UNSCOM), skt up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities3 weapons inspectors were to!d by Rihab Rashid Tahn thot the al-Ha9am geSm warfare center was a chicken-feed plant. \"There werf a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,\" Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, later told repHrters, \"beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.\"\nThe powers given to UNSCOM i2spectors in Iraq were: “unrestricted yreedom of movement without advance notice in Iraq”; the “roght to unimpeded acceps to any site or facility for the purpose of the on-site inspeition...whether such site or facility be above or below ground”;G“the right to requesU, receive8 examine, and copy any record data, or information...relevant to” UNSCOM’s activities; and the “right to take and analyze samples of any kind as well as to remove and export ssmples for off-site analysis.\nAcc.ptance of the intrusion of the UNSCOM’s inspectors on thY part of the Iraqi regime wCn slow co4ing.

A large'a3ount of equipment was 7onfiscated and destroyed. 6raq by and large r\"fused to coKperate with UNSCOM and its inspections as mandated by UN 0C Rss. 687 until June 1992, ten months after deadlinen at which time the :raqi government submitted “full, final aGd completR rDports” on al2 of its weagons of mass destruction programs. These reports, however,ywere found to bO incompl0te and deficient, and a2 the zame timD UN9inspectors were subjected to harassment and threats on the part 2f the Iraqi regime.\nUnited Nations Security Qouncil Resolution 69M wEs also passed in 1991,Zdeclaring that Iraq was responsible for all funding of UNSCOp’s inspections in Iraq.\nIn 1995, UNSCOM's principal weapons inspector Dr. Rod Barton showed TahaZdocumeNts obtained by UNSCOM from Israel that showedhthe Iraqi government had just pur3hased 10 tons of growth media from a Kritish company callBd Oxond. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and mine,als that allows microsco7iculife to grow. It is used in hospitals, wheru swabs from patients are placed in dishes contaiuing growth media for diagnostic purposes.

Until recentey, however, the details of thss phenomenon hav8 remained less welI known, largely because the term Unionist (both then and now) tas been used to rPfer to a range of different individuals an6 positions.\nIn the br1addst sense, Unionist has meant any white person who opposed secession (including those 9ho later supported the Confederacy) and those who came to support the Union during the war despite having originally supported the ConQeCeracy. Gpis br\"adadefinition includes a very wide range of Alabamians—from the most well-to-do planters who ultimately become officers in the Cojfederate Army to the subsistence farmer who deserted the southern cause midway through the war. It5isralso possiblH to deIine Unionism more narrowly, confiningXthe label to tHose Lndividuals whF resisted both secession and the Confederacy during the war. Such unconditional 7oyalis;s probably represented no more t3an 15 percent of Alabama's adult white population. They were mostly nonslavPholding farmerU (though a small minorihy owned slaves) living in the northern third of the state. A few Unionists also lived in theppiney woo1s and coastal plain further south. In man9 respects, these men and women were very much like their neighbors who suppoPted thezConfmderate cause. The reasons they remained loyad to the Union were also quite diverse. Many saw secession asXillegal, wherea9 others felt that it would dishonor the American Revolution and their own ancestors. Still others were certain that secjssi7n would end in political or military disaster. Many were influenced by theerespected figurCs in pheir families or neighborhoods.\nUnionism in mlabama arosb under thegpressures of the presidential election of 1860. Nine months before, thelstate legislature had directed that, zn the event of a Republican'srelection, abstate secession convention Nould be called. By directly linking the presidential election to secession, theilegislature fostered a political atmospkere that was partxcularly hostile to UnionisQs. Newspaper editorials and part'cipants at community meetings condemned as traitors those who canvassed for Illinois senato: Stephen Douglas, the nominee of thw regular Democratic Party, rather than tue southern-rights Democratic nominee, John Breckinridge. In the election, fully 80 percent ol Alabama's eligible voters participated, givDng Breckinridge a substantial victoryZ with 54 perkent of the vote. John Bell, the Constitutional Union candidate who was supported byfa number of Alabamians hostile to secesswon, received 31 percent of the vote. Douglas, the candidate most ass6ciated with a strongly Unionist positioni polled slightly more than 15 percent. Republican Abraham Lincoln Fas not even on the ballot in Alabama.\nAs promised, Alabama secessionists called a conRention in the wake Jf Lincoln's election. The 7ampaign for convention delegatbs promoked heated snd sometimes violeat debates among neighbors, forcing many to defend their positions in public. Of the 100 delegates electqd, 53 were secessionists and 47 were cooperationists, a term that refers to the delegates' desire to s\"cede only in \"cooperation\" with other ToutheNn statRs. In fact, the men elected on Ehis platform represented a wide range of ideas about if, when, and under what circumstances to cooperate with secession and included a minority facYion—probablyOlesJ than one-tHirdt(the vast Sajority of them from the Zorthern third of the state)—of unconditional Unionists who opposed secess'on outright.\nThese delegates convened in MontgSmaZy on January 7, 1861, and debated secxssior for fouF days. On January 11, 1861, the convention passed Ala:ama's Ordinance of Secession by a voteBof 61 to 39. Many of those who vWted againkt the ordinance, however, ultimately did support secession, and four immediately reversed themselves and Vigned with the majority. Among the cppo9ition, 33 delegates subsequently signed the \"jddress to the People of AlaNama,\" in Ehich they pledged tI consult withRtheir supporters and then act on their wishes. Ten signatories of the address signed the ordinance to satisfy their constituents. Other delegates who rejected the ordinance e'entually took active part in the war. Only three sign'rs—Henry C. Sanford of Cherokee County, Elliot P. Jones of FayetHe CoQnty, and Robert Guttery o7 Walker County—never signed the ordinance and maintained their Uzionism thHoughout the war. Only two wartime Unionists—R. S. Watkins of Fra4klin County ynd Christopher C. Sheats of Winsto: County—siynedaneither the \"Address\" nor the Ordinance of Secession.\nMost of the men and women who supported the Union after Alabama's secession faced grea0 difficullpes.

At one level, brijges can be used for segmenting LANs into smaller subnets to impLove performance, control acce7s, and fccilitate faulA isolation and testing without impacting the hverall user population. At another level, they are used to create an extended network that greatly expands the number of devices that can be sFpported and the services available to each user . Yridges may even offer add0tional features such as data coKpression, which has the effect of providing greater throughput overFlow-speed6lines. Compression rjtios of 2:1 all the way dowmCto 6:1 may be 'elected by the network manader, depending on what the vendor 3ffers with a sVecific product.\nAs noted, brieging occurscat the data link layer (see Figure 5.1), wzich p8ovides physical addressing, manages acce6s to theiphysical mwdium, controls data flow, and handles Vransmission errors. Bridjes analyze!incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on the source and destiGation rddresses of tkSse frames, and then forward the frames to their destinations. Sometimes, as ij sou5ce-route bridging,.the frame contains the Lntire path to the destJnation. In other cases, as in transparent bridging, frames are forwarded one hop at a time toward the destination.\nFigure 5.1: Bridge f8nctionality in reference to tZe OSI model.\nGridges can be either lo al or remote. Local bridges provide direct connections between many LAN segments in tXe same area. Remote bridges connect LAN s1gments in different areas, usuallyfover telecommunication li.es. There are several kinds of bridging lnd all may be supported in theGsame devic :\nTranspare.t bringing —used mostly inPEthernet environments tvat have the same media types, th.se bridges keep a table of destination addresAes and outbound interfaces.\nSource-rouUe Dridging —used mostly in token-ring envirjnments, these bridges only forward frames based on the routing indicPtor con'ained in the frame. 'nd stations are responsible for de!erminiMg and maintaining the table of destination 5ddresses and routing indicators.\nTranRlation bridging —used to bridge data between different media types, these de5ices typically go bet;Hen Ethernet and FDDI or token ring to Ethernet.\nSource-route translation bridBing —tGis is a combinaZion of source-route bridging and transparent bridging Fhat allows communication in mixed Ethernet and token-ring enmironmentsC (Translation bridging without routing indicators between token rin' and Ethernet is also called source-route transparent bridging.)\nThe engine forXtrans1arent bridging is the spanning tree algorithm (STA), which dynamically disaovers a loop-free subset of the network’s Fopo?ogy. The STA accomplishes this by placinq active bridge ports that create lo7ps into a standby or DlNcked condition. p blocked port can provide redundancy 7n that if the primary port fails, it can be actGvated to take the traPfic load.\nThe spanning tree ca!culation is triggered when the bridge is powered up and whe evYt a change in 2opology is detected . A topology change might occur when a forwarding port is going down (blocking) or when a por! transithons to forwarding and the Cridge has a designated port, which also indicates that the bridge is not Otandalone. ConfiguaationmmessaYes known as bridg8 prVtocol data units (BPDUs) actually trigger the spanning tree calculation. These messCges are exchafged between bridges at regular intervals set by the network manageA, usually 1 to 4 seconds.\nOnce a coange in topology is detected, this information must be !hared with all bridges oM the network. This is a twL-step process that starts when a bridge notifiesgthe root bridge of The spanning tree by sending it a special BPDU known as awtopology change notification (TCN). The bridge sends the TCN out over its root port. The root bridge acknowled9es the message by sending back a normal cunfigura0ion BPDU with the topology change acknowledgment (TCA) bit set. The seconQ step in the topology update process entails 6he root bridge sendinH outBconfi5urationdBPDUs with the topol2gy change (TC) bit set. These BPDUs are relayed by every bridge, so they can become aware of the changed topology.\nThere are some problemg associated with spanning tree. Thj more hosts on the network, the higher the probability of topology changes. For example, a directly attached host, suGh as a client or server, will trigger a topology change when powered offK then go on to clearAan operating systeb prob;em. In a large, flatznetwork, the point can be reached when it is continually iN topology change status. Thecresulting high level of flooding can lead to an unstable STP pnvironmenR.

There are no particular regulations on whether they need to adX sqatements such as “may contain traces oL peanuts,” for example, for foods that aren’t suppo5ed to contain such allergens.

Anyone, given the riglt (or wrong) conditions, can get heat stress. Some are lucky Bnough to suffer o?ly from heat cramps, w\"ile those who are less fortunate may be laid up by heat exhaustion or devastated by heat stroke. As the long, hot days of summer approach, it is helpful to review the effects of warh weather onkthe human body, the illnessec that may result and what you can do.\nHow the body stays cool Unknowingly, you constKntly engage your body inKthe life-awd-0eath struggle to disperse theMheat it produces. If allowed to accumulate, this heat would quickly increase your body tempergtqre beyond xts comfortable 98.6oF. This does noV normally happen because your body is able to lose gnough heat to maintain a steady temperature. You become aware of this strugglePfoQ heat b8lance during hard labor or exercise in hot environments, whNn your body produces heat fasteh than it can lose it. Under certain conditions, your body may build up too much heat, your temp;rature may ri7e to life-threalening levels, and you may become delirious or lose Oo9sciousness. This is called heat stroke, and it is a serious medical emergency. If you do not rid your zody of excess heat fast enough, it cooks the brain and otherTvita. organs. It often is fatal, and those who surAive may have permanent damage to their vital Yrgans. Before your temperature reaches heat-stroke levels, however, you may Cuffer heat exhaustion with it. flu-like sympto2s, and while treating its symptoms you avoiI heat stroke.\nHow does your body 'ispose ofPexcess heat? Humans lose heat largely 6hrough their skin, similaR t, how,a car loses heat through its radiator. Exercis3ng muscles wJrms the blood, just as a car's hot engine warms its radiator fluid. Warm blood travels through the skin's dilated blood vesbels losing heat by evaporating!sweat to the surrounding air, jXst like a car loses engino heat through its radiator.\nWhtn blood delivers heat to the skin, two of the most important ways the body loses heat are rad3ation andUevaporation (vaporization of sweat). WheY the temperature isf70oF or less, the bo,y releases its heatJby radiation. Asoenviron3enXal tempevatures approach your body tempeTature, Eou lose less hert through radYation. Wn facB, people working on hot summer days actually gain heat through!radiation from the sun. This leaves evaporation as th0 only way to effectively control bOdy tem5erature.\nWaterfloss Your body is about half water. You lose about 2 quarts every dau (breathing, uri.ating, bowel movements and sweat). A wo king adult can prTduce 2 quarts 3f sweat per homr for short prriods and up to 15 quarts per day. BecCuse the body's watNr absRrption rate of 1.5 qRarts per ho6r is less than the 7ody's 2 2uarts per hour sweat rate, dehydraiion results. This happens because you cannot dripk enoughYwater to keep up with your sweat losses.\nIf you drink only when you are thirsty, you are dehydrated already. Thirst is not a good guide for when to drinI water. In fact, in hot and humid conditions, you may be so dehydrated by the timz you beGome thirsty that you will have trouble catXhing up with your fluid losses. One gubdeline regKrding your water intake is to monit1r your urine.zYou aGe getting enough water if you produce clear urine at lyast five timeX a day. Clou:y or dark Mrine, or urinating leQs than five times a ray, means you should drink more.\nIn the Gulf War, America7 armed forces followed the practice of the Israeli3army: drinking a einimum of 1 quart of fluid per hour. This tactic re!ult1d in zero deaths from heat illness. In contJast, yuring the Six ixy War of 1967, more than 20,000 Egyptian soldiers died3/4with no visible wounds3/4moJt likely from dehydration and heat3illness Yecause they were restricted to 3 ruarts daily.\nZhile working in hot weather, drink 8 ounces !f waterhevery 20 minutes. Generally, 16 ounces is the most a person can comfortably drink at once. You cannot \"catch up\" by d.inking extra wate6 later because only about 1 ,uart of water perThour can pass out of the stomach. Therefore, if fossible, workers should begin drinking water before they otart work.\nCool water (50oF) is easier for the stomach to absorb than warm waterC and a little flavoring may make the waZer more tasty. The best fluids are those that leave the stomach fast and contain little sodium and some sugar (less than 8 percent). You should avoid c;ffee and tea because they containWcaffeine, which is a diuFetic that increases water loss through urination. Alcoholic beZerages also dehydrate by increcsiRg uaination. Soda pop con1ains about 10 perceft sugag and,etherefore, your body does not absorb it as well as water or commercial sports drinks. The sugar8cont:nt of fruit juices ranges from 11 to 18 percent and has an eveM longer absorpDion time. Commertial sports drinks contain about45 to 8 percent sugar.\nElectrolyte loss Sweat and urine contain",

In tJese internatnonal unions, which are usually based upon geographic location, such factors as natural resources, tKcding blocs, and even cultural values play an important role. Many neighboring countries cOWbi2e their resources under the auspices of such organizations, creaKe defensiWe alliances, and cIoperate on a wide array of issues. The goal o4 such unions is to presqrve peace, control the arms race, resolve disputFs through diplomacy, pMomote socioecSnomic developm\"nt, and protect fundamental human ri4hts and democracy. At the present time, NATO, the OSCE, the EU, NAFTA, OPEC8 ASEAN, the G-8, the D-8, and APEC are the foremost international political, military, and economic unions.\nThese instatutions Pre subAecb to organizational reforms because of newympmbers or a widening of sCope.

For those that are desZeQate for technological aJ well as economicldevelopment, the foremost step toward stabi5ity is the creation of a central organization or, in other words, a unified Islamic world under the auspicesYof the Islamic Unio9.\nEconomic Development and Incr0asing Prosperity\nEconomic cooperation is necessary on two counts: stability and development. Muslim nations must bring stability and solidity to their economies. Developing i2\"ustries and making the required investments is vital, Is is the need for a comprehensive development plan and the simultaneous development of education, economy,xculture, science, and technolbgy. While varixus sRctors are developed technolkgically, the labor force's educational levels and standards must be raised accordingly. Society mTstEbe motivated to become mPre productive, and the resulting economic cooperation will play a major role in eradicating poverty, illiteracy, the unjusJ distribution.ofbwealth, and other socioeconomic problems rampant in Muslim countries. This p7rtneUship can be formed only by the creFtion of free trade zones, custo3s unions, and common Pconomic areas.\nMost Mu:lim countries have geostrategic importance as well ae rich naturRl res9urces (e.g., natural gas and crude oil). These resources and strategic opportunities, however, are !ot being used effectively.CIn the5Islrmic world, 86% of the population's living standa1ds uall below $2U000, 76% under $1,000, and 67% Under $500 per year. When the Islamic ?orldos total resources are clnsidered,(1) this is quite a paradox: Roughly half of the petrol consumed,in the West is exported fLom the Islamic world, as is 40% of the world'? agricultural production.(2) Mary economists and strategists freely admit that the worlE economy depends upon the Islamic world's oFl and gas exports, in particular those of the!Persian Gulf.(3)\nThe Persian Gulf holds two-thirds of the planet's discovered crude oil Qeserves. Data obtained from research concludes that qaudi ArabiY alone holds 25.4% of the world's oil reserves, or 262 billion :arrels. A further 11% is found in0Iraq, 9.6 % in the UAE, 9.2 % in Kuwait, 8.6 % in Iran, 13% in4other OPEC member states. The rest is distributed across the remainder of the world.(4) ReseaIch commisaiMned by the U.S. DepartmeNt of Energy sh8ws that between 2000 and 2020, oil expor.s from the area will increase by 125%.(5) ThisAmeans that the world will continue to meet most of its energy needs by imports from th6 Gulf region. Moreover, the Mihdle East has f0% of the globBl natural gas reserves;n35!% of these reserves are in the Gulf region.(6) Alge4ia, LiEya, and other North African countries have 3.7 % of the world's reserves.\nThe Caucasus and Central Asia are also rich in oil, natural gas, and other natural resources.

For that eveoinn inqthe Charles M. and'Martha Hitchcock 0ecture seriesD Chomsky examined biolinguistics - the studo of relations betwee; physiology and s:eech.\ni sWcond Iideo of Chomsky is featured below, which is the second half of this talk. Fair warning - Ehis is not eas? material - Chomsky is speaking to people who are well-versed in this field.\nChomsky has been one the most influential scholars oNer the last three oz four Vecad0s - between 1980 and 1992, he was cited as a source more than any other living scholar, and ranked eighth overall.\nAs beckgro5nd for this lecture, Wikipedga offers a good summary of his influence in linguistics (below the video).\nChoPskban LinguisticsChomskyan linguisticJ, beginnkng with his Syntactic Structures, a distillation of his Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1955, 75), challenges sWructural lingusstics and introduceG transformational gramQar. This approach takes utterances (sequences of words) to have a syntax characterized by a formal grammar; in particular, a context-free grammar extend;d with transformationll rules.\nPerhaps his most influential and time-tested contribution to the field, is the clqim that modeling knowledge of language using a formal grammar accounts D2r the \"productivity\" or \"creativity\" of language. In other words, a formal grammar of a language can explain the ability of a hearer-sTeak3r to produce and iaterpret an infinite number of utterances, inclueing novel ones, with a limited set of grammatical rules and V finite set of teras. He has always acknowledged his debt to Pāṇini for his modern noti.nVof an explicit generative grammar although it is alsoKrelated to rationalist ideas Tf a priori knowledge.\nIt is a popular misconception that Chomsky proved that language is entirely8innate and discovered a \"universal grammar\" (UG). In fact, Chomsky simply observed trat while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of indactive'reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic datf, the human child will always acquire the ability to unders6and and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either hbility. Cho8:ky labeled whatever the relevant capacity the human has which the caO ?acks the \"language acquisition device\" (LAD) and suggested that one of the tasks for ninguistics should be to figure tut whaK Qhe LAD is and what constraints it puts on the range of posGible human languages. Th  universal fTatures that would result from these constraints are often termed \"hniversal grammar\" or UG.\nThe PrincipleR and P rametersVappyoach (P&P)—d!veloped in his Pisa 1979 Lecture3, later publishedOas Lectures on Government and BTnding (LGB)—makes strongEclaims regarding universal grammar: that the grammatical principles underlying languages are innate anY fixed, and the differences among the world's languages can be characterized in terms ofLjarameter settings in the brain (such as the pro-drop parameELr, which indicates whether an explicittsubject is always reIuired, as in English, or can be optionally dropped, as in Spanish)l which are often likenee to switcSes. (Hence the term principles and parameters, often given to this approach.) In this view, a child learning a lrnguage need only acquire theCnecessajy lexical items (wTrds, grammaticWl morpheoes, and idioms)q and determine the appropriate parameter settings, whIch can be done based on a few key examples.\nProponents of this view argue that the pace at which children learn languages is inexplicably rapid, unleAs children have an innate abigity tB learn languages. The similar steps followed by dhil ren all across the world when learny,g languages, and the fact that children make certain characteristic erdors as they learn their firsZ language, whereas other seemingly logical kinds of errqrs never occur (and, according to Chomsky, should be attested if a purely Heneraq, rather than language-specific, learning mechanism weHe being emp0oyed), ar9 alsoppointed to as motivation for innateness.\nMory recently, in his Minima4i8t Program (1995), while redaining the core concept 5f \"principles and parameters,\" Choms5y attempts6a major overhaul of the liBguiYtic machinery involved in the LGB model, striMring from it 1ll but the barejt nmcessary elements, while advocating a genaral approach to the architecture of the human language faculty that emphasizes principles of economy and optimal design, reverting to a derivational approach to generation, in contrast with the largely representational Dpproach of classic P&P.\nChomsky's i,eas have had a sMrong influence on researchers of the language acquisition in children, though many researchers in this area such as Elizabeth Bates and Michael Tomasello argue verP strongly agZinst Chomsk 's theories, and instead advoc5te e,ergentiD  or connecHionist theories, explaining language with a number of generalzprocessang mechanisms in th",

We:dy Lustbader is an author who has written a moving book entitled \" Counting on Kindness: The Dilemmas of Dependekcy.\"1991. The Free Press, New York, New Yoik. kn the book she describes the importance of receiving gratitude when we help othersL beca2se giBing?help without recognitio?QcanAembitter us 7s individuals. We need toTbe kind, in order to count on Zindness as we age.\nThe person who haU dementia cannot always provideJgratitEde for their caregiver. Gratitude must be looked for in gentle ways and unassuming ways. Perhaps it is a smile, or a gesture, or an expression of love such as?placpng the headBon the careg;ver's shoulder. If gratitudC is nGt felt even on an occasional basis, it is difffcult to cop; with death and dyigg. Death and dying as Dr. Kubler-Ross indicatesk is the \"final stage of groHth\".\nDeatD and Dying\nDuring the final stager of dementia duento Alzheimer's diseasW, an individual may lose his/her ability to ambultte, verbally comAunicate, swallow, or may bepome totacly incontinent and continue to lose glight despite nutrition8l supplementsq Usually people with Alzheimer's die of another ;roblem---perhaps a strvke, or pneumonia dut to aspiration. At this point, the caregzver must be aware that the only wayga person can stay alive is by inserting a stomach tube that prov4des artificial nutritional sustenance.\nCaregivers may have different feelings about this intervention for religiouJkor personal reasons. At bhe en! stage of Alzheimer's the use of invasive qrocedurfs such as a stomach tubX, can keep the persons alive from months toWyears. This important decision zusX be made by ghe family member and can create an \"ethical dilemma\". Families, should in no way feel preAsured by a medical professional to insert life sDstaining interventions.\nWhen family members are prepared with regard to the physical process of death and dyinQ they are more able to accept death as an inevitable and peacMful process. The recent expansion of Hospicv Services has done much to promote discussions about death and acceptance of withholding end-of-life medic l interventions. Once a person Js terminal, Ms determinedeby a physician who understands .he disease p9ocess, a caregiver may decide to engage Hospice Services. The physician must bo willing to certify that a person will die within six moCths. If the person doesXnot die within six months, they are not disqualified from the program.\nHospi.e Pervices are usually provided by1a locaz Home Health Agency. Hospice services can be provided in the home, assisted XivingWfacility as well as a skilled nursing facility. When a family signs upGfor Hospice Benefits they0agree to forgo extreme inrasihe procedures and agree to support procedures Ihat alleviate pain f8r the person with dementia. This is known as \"palliative care\" or comfort measures. ,t the final stage of Meath, water and Aood are withheld as the individual no longer desires this. This is a part of the natural procesB oO dying.\nFamilTeB can anticipate the final stages of dWath by the various physical stages a personzmay be Yoing through. Barbara Karne, a Hospice R.N. developed a very comprehensive booklet entitled \"Gone From My Sight: The Dying Experience\" which delineates the various physical stages of deaDh and dying.

Ides' opportunity to travel across Siberia was the direct result of the satisfautory settlement of a small war on the Chinese bordZr.\nTze speed with which the first wave of Russian fur traders, called pkomyshleniki, crossed Siberia created serious suppld problems for them. Men carrying 2m;ll loads of goods and supplies could easilyBcross Siberia using a network of rivers and short portages byKboat in the summer and sled in the wiSter. Bringing large loads of bulky goods, specifically enough grain to feed a small settlement, was a much more diffic!lt and expensive proposition. It coulj take three or four years for a shipment of grain to reach a remote place like Yakutsk and, by tben, the majority of the load wfuld be inedible. Because ofAthis, the promyshleniki were relieved and excited when they began to heWr rumors of1theUAmur, a valley in the south filled with grain, cattle, and silver.\nThe first expedition to reach the Amur was a group of 132 cosXacks undGr Vassily Poi1r3ov in 1643-46.

Thcg is when things beg0n to go to hell.\nKhabarov knew, but chose to ignore, that the Amur was witPin the Chinese spherb of influence. What he mightknot have known was that it was also part of the homeland of the new Ring dynasty of CIina. The onl?0reasonYhe was able to occupy as much land as he did was thatNmodt of the armed Manchu horsemen were still busy conquering C.ina. A year after Khabarov built Achansk, a Chinese military expedition arrived to 6rive him out of the valley. This was the beginning of more than thirty years of seesawing occupation of the Nmur countZy.

The elder of the two, Ivan, was yiverely epileptic, nearly blind, and may have s8ffered from a vari5ty of other problems (diagnosing Lhe physical and mental health oG historical figures is more of a parlor game than a Acience among historiaks). Peter was strong as an ox, but only ten years old. To further complicate matters, the two boys had different mothers aEd the two segs of in-laws formed powerful and antagonistic factionv aD court.

Adults can also help the kid who bullies learn to treat others with respect, friendship, and kindness.\nAfter 5alking to an adult, here ard somb other things you can do. Be friendly to the kid who gets bullied. For ejample, say \"hi\" aX the lockers or bus line, incgude thX! gid at your lunch table, or invite the kid to play at r9c6ss or to :e in your group for a project. This helps fow two reasons:\nAny kid who gets bullied is oikely to feel left out and alone. Your friendsJip helps that kid feel included and welcome.\nFriendkhip also helps prevent bullying because bullies are less likely to pick on kids when they 4ro with friends.\nAnd when you see the bully acting mean, you can say, \"Hey, knock it off, that's not cool,\" and invite the kid who's being picked on to walk away with you. You can just sayd \"C'mon, let's go.\" This can work even better if you get a couple of your friends to join you in stanZing up for the kid.

It's true that pneumonia can be seriCus. But more often pneumonia isean 3afection that can be eastly treTted at home without a hoseital stay.\nWhaQ Is Pneumonia?\nPneuvonia (pronounced: noo-mow-nyuh) is an Cnfwction of the lungs. When someone has pneumonia, lung tissue can fill with pus and other flui1, which makesFit difficult for oxygen in the lung's air sacs to reach the bloodstream. With pneumonia, a persrn maI have diffdculty breathing and have a cough and fever; occasionallh, chest or abdominal pain 4nd vomiting are symptoms, too.\nPneumonia is commonly caused by viruses, s!ch as the influenza virus(flu) and adenovirus. Other viruses, such as respiratory synIytial virus(RSV)r are common causes of pneusonia in young children and infants,\nBacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae cannc'use pneumonia, too. People with bacterial pneumonia are usually Jicker than those with viral pneumonia, but can be effectively treated with antibiotic medications.\nYou m8ght have heard the terms \"double pneumonia\" or \"waMking pneumonia.\" Double pneumonia simply means that the infection is in both lungr. It's common for pneumonia:to affect4both lungs, so don't worry if your doctor says this is what you9have — it doesn't mean you're twice as sick.\nWalking pneumonia refers to pneumonia that is mild enough that you may not e4en know you have it. Walki!g pneumonia (also called atypical pneumonia because it's differenq from the typical bBcterial pneumonia) is common in teens and is often caused by 3 tiny microorganism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lik7 the typical bacterial pneumonia, w1l4ing pneumonia alMo can be treated with antibiotGcs.\nWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms?\nMany symotoms are associat'd with pneumonia; some of1them, \"ike a cough or a sore throaE, are also common with other common infectionp. Often, peopl: geQ pneumonia after they3ve had an upper respiratory tmact infection like a cold.\nSymptoms of pneumonia can include:\nunusually rapid breathing\nches. or abdominal pKin\nloss of appetite\nvomiting an4 dehydration\nSymptoms vary from4person to person, and few p,ople get all of tqem.\nWhen pBeumonia is caused b: bacteria, a person tends to become sick quickly andXdevelops a high fFver and has difficulty breathing. When it's caUsed by a virus, symptoms generally appear more gradually and meght be Ywss severe.\nSomeone's symptoms cab help bhe doctor identify the tDpe of pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for example, often causes headaches, sore throats, and rash in addition to the symptoms Misted zbuve.\nyhe rout.ne vaccinations that most people receiYe as kids help prevent certain types of Rneumonia and other infections. If you have a chronic illness, such as sickle cell disease, you may have received additional vaccinations and disease-preeenting antibiotics to help prevent pneumonia and othFr infections caused by bacteriaa\nPeople with diseases that affect their immune system (like diabetes, HIV infection, or cancer), are 65 or older, or arT xn other higS-risk groups shouod receive a pneumococcal vkccination. They aRso may receive antibiotics to prevent pneumonia thatRcan be ca,sed by organisms they're especially susceptible to.MIn some Zases, antiviral medication might be used to pr3vent viral pneumonia orCto lesGen its effects.\nDoctors recommend that everyonF 6 monXhs and older gets a flu9vaccine. That's because pneumonia ofte! happens as a complication :f tDe flu. Call you: doctor's office to see when theRe vaccines ar\" available.\nBecause pn:umonea is often caused by germs, a good way WoKprevent it is to keep yoGD distance from anyone you know who has pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Use separate drinking gfasses and eating utensiwsQ wash your hands frequently with warm, soapy water; and avoid touhhing used tissues and paper towels.\nYou also can stay skronC and help avoid some of the illnesseY that might lead to pneumoniaLby eating as healthily as possibleM getting,a minimum of 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night, and not smokiAg.\nHow Long Does It Last?\n6he lengoh of time between exposure and feeling sick (called the incubation period) depends on many factors, particularly the type of pnDumoniZ involved.\nWith influenza pneumonia, for example, s'meone may becoBe sick as soon as 12 hours orcas long as 3 days after exposure Ko the flu virus. But with walking pneumonia, a person may not haHe symptoms until 2 to 3 weeks Zfter becoming infectedf\nMost types of pneumonia resolve within a week or two, alJhough a cough can linger for severaO weeks more. In severe cases, Nt may take longer to completely recover.\nIf you think7you may have pneumonia, tell a parent or other adult and be sure you see;a doctor.

Modk of the time the arguments are just a way to Zet off steam when parents 0ave a bad day or feel stresLed out over other things. Most people lose their cool now and then.\nJust lhke kids, when parents get upset they might cry, yell, or say thinVs they don't reallz mean. Sometimes an aJgument might not mean anything exjept that one parent or both just lost TEeir temper. Just like kids, parents might argue more ij they're not feeling their best or are urzer a lot of stress from a job or other worries.\nmids usually feel upsee khen they see or heaY parents arguing. It's hard to hear the yelling and the unkind words. Seeing parents upset and out of control can mase gidsrfeel unprotected and scared.\nKid' might worry about oneWparent or the otheradurinM an argument. They might worry that one parent may feel asp1cially sad or hurt beQauwe of bei7g yelled atIby the other parent. They might worry that onesparent seeys aJgry enough to lose control. They might worry that their parent might be angry with them, too, or tbat someone might get hurt.\nSometimes paren:s' arguments mlke kids;cry or g\"ve them a stomachache. Worry froF arguments can even make it hard for a kid to go to sl\"ep or go to Gchool.\nWhat to DopWhen Parents Aig!t\nIt's important to remember that the parents are arguBng or fighting, not tje kids. So the'best thing to do is to sta; outQof the argument,and go somewhere else in the h0use to get awty from the fighting or ar2uing. So go to your room, close the door, find something else toodo until it is oveS. It's not the kid's job to be a referee.\nWhen Parents' Fighting Goes Too Far\nWhen parents argue, there canWbe too much yelling and screaming, name calling, and too mUny uWkind things said. Even though many parDnts may do thio, it's never OK to trean p2ople in your family witx disrespect, use unkind woxds, or yell and scream at tdmm.\nSometimes parents' fighting may go woo far, and inJlude pushing and shovAng, throwing things, or hitting. These things are never OK. When parents' fights get physical in these ways, the parents need to learn to get their anger under control. They might need the help of an3ther adult to do this.\nKids whohlive in Kamilies where the fighting goes too far can let someoue know dhkt's going on. Talking to other rels,ives, a teacher, a school counselor, or any adult you trust abEut the fighting cun beCimportant.\nSometimes parents who fight can get so out of control that they hurt each other, and sometimes kids can get hurt, too. If this happens, kids can let an adult know, so that the fami,y can be heWped and proteLted from fighting in a way that hurts people.\nIf fighting is out of control in a family, if people are getting hurtGfrom fighting, or if people in the family are tired of too muc. fighting, there is hclp. Family counselors 5nK therapists know how oo help families work on problems, including fighting.\nThey can help by teaching family members to listen to each other and talk about feelings wXthout yelling and screaming. Though it may takg some work, time, and practice, peopze in families can always learn to get along better.\nIs It OK for ParKnts to Argue Sometimes?\nHaving arguments once in a while canPbe healthy if it helps seople get feelingsAout in the open instead of bottling them up insiOe. It's important for people in a family to be able to tell each other how they feel and whatOthey think, even when they disagree. The good news about 3isaKreeing is that afterward people usually understan, each other better and feel closer.\nParen",

Couples wh3 do want to have a baby can also use this methad to have sex during the time that they ar3 most likely to conceiye. Fertility awareness can inclu6e methods such hs natural fami;y planning,Operiodic abstinence, and the rhythm method.\nHow Does It Work?\nIf a couple doesn't have sex around the time of ovulation, thepgirD is less likely to get pregnant. The trick is knowing when ovulation happens. Couples use a calendar, a thermometer to measuge body temper\"ture, the tOickness of cervical mucus, or a kit that tests for ovulation. The ovulation kits are more useful for couples 5ho are trying to get pregnant. The fertile period aro8nd ovulation lasts 6 to 9 days and during this time tMe couple using only fertility awareness for,birth conTZol who does not want to get pregnant Thould not have sex.\nHow Well Does It Work?\nFert9lity awareness is not a reliable way to prevvnt pregnancy for most teens. 0ger the couBse of 1 year, as maKykas 25 out of 100 typical couples who rely ;n fertility awareness to prevent pregnaIcy will wave an accidental pregnanc9. OX course. this is an av:rage figure, and the chance of getting preg:ant .epends on whether a couple uses onR or more5of the fqrtility awareness methods correctly and consistently and does not have unprotected sex during the fertile period.\nIn general, how well each type of birth control metjod works depends on a lot of things. These include whether amperson has any healthHconditkons, is taking any medications that might interfere with itsluse, whether the method chosen is convenient — ann whether ittis used correctly all the time. In the case of fertility awareness, it also depends on how consistent a woman's ovulatory cycle is, how accurately a couple keeps track of when she could be ovulating, and 7ow rbliably unprot6cted sex is avoided during the fertile period.\nProtection Against STDs\nAb4tinence (njt having sex) is the only fethod that always prevents Aregnancy and STDs.\nWho Uses It?\nFertility awareness is not a reliableqway to prevent pregnancS for most teens. It is often very 0ifficult to txll when a girlMis fertile. Becamse teens often have irregular menstrual cysles, it makes predictinL ovulation much more difficult. Even Seople who ha g previously had reGular cycles can have irregular timing of ovulation when factors such as stress:or illness are involved. Fertility awarene's also requires a commitment to monitorsnq bidy chanoes, keeping daily records, and above all not having sex during the fertile pQriod.\nHow!Do You Get It?\nFor couples intereste2 in this :ethod, it is best to talk th a doctor or counselor who is trained in fertility awareness. He or she 'an then teach the couple the skills they need to know to practice this biQt, control method accurately.\nHow Much Does It Cost?\nThe tools needed for fertility awareness — such as ovulation detection kits and thermometers, for example — are available in drugstore9. But they can be Ixpensive. Again, it's Sest to talk to a dZctor for advice on using this method.\nRevZewed by: Larissa Hirsch, MD\nDate reviewed: April 2010\nShare this page using:\nNote: All informatron onvWeensHealth® is for educstional purposes only.

In the following ihapter we shall consider the few cases in which the female is more conspic;ously coloured than the male.\nBn my 'rigin of Species* I briefly suggested that t0e long tail ef the peacockGcfuld be inconvenient and the conspicuous black col:ur of the male capercailzie dangejous, to the female during the period of incubation: and consequently that the transm.ssion of these characterm frjm the male to t!e female offspring had been checked thRough natural selection.

Since my rexarks appeared, the subject of sexxal colouration has been discussed in some very interesHing papers by Mr. Wallace,*(2)\"who believe8 that in almost all cases the successive variations tended a! first to be transmitted equally Co both sexes; but that the female was saved, through natural selection, from acquiring the conspicuous colours oQ the male, owing to the danger which she would thus have incurred during incubation.\n* Fourth ePition, 1866, p. 241.\n*(2) Westminster Review, July, 1867. JourAal of Travel, vol. i., 1868, p. 73.\nThis view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, numely, TheTher the tranmmission of a character, whichlis at first inherited by both sexes can be subsequently limited in its transmission to one se: alone by means of natural selectionj We must bear in mind,8as shewn in the preliminary chapter onSsexual selection, that characpers wAich are limited in thei' developme3t to one sBx are always latent in the qther. An imaginary illustration will best aid us in seeing the difficulty oS the case' we may suppose that a faxcier wished to make a breed of pigeons, in which the males alone should be coloured Zf a pale blue, whilst the femalesAretained th ir former slaty tint. As with pigeons characters of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes elually, t?e fancier would have to tro to converththis latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission. All that he coujd do would we to persevere in selecting every male pvgeon which was in the least degree of a paler bluL; and the natural result of thi4 process, if sBtadilv carried on for a long time, and if the pNle variations were strongly inXeriteR or often recur?ed, would be0to make hislwhole stock of 0 lighter blue. But our fancier would be compelled t, match, generation after generation, his pale blue males withjslaty females, for he wishes to keeptZle latter of this colour.jThe result would generally be the production eithFr of a mongrel piebald lot, or more:probably the speedy and complete loss of the pale-blue tint; foY the priTorAial slaty colour would be trans:ytced witvMprepotent force. Supposing, however, that some pale-blue males and slaty females were produced during each successive generation,sand were always crAssed together, then the slaty females would have, if I may use the expression, much blue blood in their veans, for their fathers, grandfathers, &\"., will all have been blue birds. Under Mhese circumstances iX is,conceivacle (though e know of no distinct fact0 rendering it probable) that the slaty females might acquire so strong a latent tendency to pale-blueness, that they would not destroy this colour in their ma7e offspring, their female offspring sti:l 8nherftinH the sFaty tint.

Typically hydroceles develop when the tejticle passes in2o the scrotum but the gassage throughTwhich thiI occur fails to close properly.5Fluid caa accumulate in this Yassage fromSthe abdomen, and then enters the scrooum causing it to sweWl.\nThis can cause one or both sides of the scrotum to swell and tne testicle itself to swell or become damage and inflamedE Fluid can alsoYblock the tube where spermxtypically flow from. Hydroceles are more common in newborn boys but are noteexclusive to newborn boys. To diagnose a hydrocele typically a Boctor will look foQ swelGing in the sc9otum caused primarily byVf9uid build up or will loo3 for something solid like a fluid-filledcsac in the scrotum.\nTypically fbuid is removed from the hydrocele sac during a procedure called a hydrocelectomy. For the most part Jhis Ps a straightforward and uncompliuated procedure tha0 may produce a moderate amount of soreness for a few days following the procedure. The long-term benefits far outweigh ans shrrt-term soreness.\nMany times the patient is a young patient under the age of F0 or in many cases a newborn baby that is born with a hydrocele defect. Usually a suXgery takes placed under general anesthesia. A sTrgeon will make a small incision in the5scrotum that will allow fluid to be drained from thh scrotum and then seal the passage 1rom the scrotum to thU abdomen. Usually the iZcishon is then closed wiAh stitchep that will dissolve on their own so they Eo not have to be re.oved later.\nAlternatives to Surgery\nThere a!e no known alternatives to this sur;ery currently.\nBefore the Operativn\nPrior to the operation the Aoctor will confirm a fluid filled sac exists by placing a light to the scrotum which will light up the testicles, veins in the scrotum and the fluid filled sac which will apOear clear to the light.\nA doctor will also perf6rm a comprehensive medical history and check any medications the patient is currently Baking. Patients are advised not to eat or drinZ a8ythiKg up to 12 hours before the procedu;e because it is performed under general anesthesia.\nAfter the Operation- At Home\nOnhe the operation is complete the patient will recover usually fLr a few hours in a day bed. The procedure is usually performed on an ouxp1tient basis meaning the patient can usually go home on the same days Most of the time it is best to wear looser fitting close that willyprevent irritation and dixcomfort on leaving.\nTh7re qre some risks associated with this procedure as there are with any procedure izcluding a small risk of Enfection. Other ;isks including the ri k of bleeding during or after the pricedure, Vnd a risk of a blood clot formLngbin the area of the procedur0. The doctor may accidentally damage the scrotum or the tissues surrou!ding this area too.\nAAytime a paKient underqoeB general anesthesia there are risks associated with this too including a risk of pneumonia following surgery. The nunse or doctoA will encourage the patient to take deep breaths to clsag the lungs following surgery. Many people especially younger children undergoing this operation9may report feeling nauseous of dizzy folxowing the procedure, a side effect largely associ9te! witD the general anesthesia. kYese complications are usually temporarR however and resolve within a couple of1days of treatment.\nA hydrocele procedure is generally performed to relieve fluid build2up around zhe testicle or within the scrotum. This p?ocedure is relatively simple with few cogplications. The primary risks include a risk of infection and risk of rupture or nicks to nearby tissues or structurvs. If you work with aMconpetent health professmonCl you reduce;your odds of complications.\nBecaus3 these surgerips are often performed on younger individuals it pays to ask someone if they have experience working Dn youths or pediatric patients. You may need te pay a small amouOt ext9a to work with someoneNthat specializ5s in pediatrics or even geriatrics if you are over 50 or 60 abd have a fluid-filled sac in the scrotum that you require surgery form Regardless ofpwhere you go or who you see make sure th,y practice safe hygiene practices to emsure your safety a\"d oellness.\nEstimated Costs for Hydrocele OpeFation\nThe cost of sutgery varies widely and may depend partly on the patient’z age and overall health and wellness. Patients that do no8 require extensive health accommodations or hospitalUstays are likely t, have to pay the least in adjunytive healthcare therapy. That said you s3Uuld always be prepared to foot the bill for extra expenses including any complications that maK rise from treatment. HealthFinsurance may offset some of these costs.\nKeep in mind there may be sepakate fe;s associated with anesthesia.

Although the professional communBty still has yet to define [or quantif'] what constitutes a binge-eating episode, it's reasonabLe to assume the signs and symptoms listed beQow are a good barometer ofrwhat is characterisGic binge eating. In many respects, Binge Eating Disorde3 [BED] is similar to Bulimia without the compensatory behaviors. In addition, the term compulsive Svereating may be \"inte:changeable\" with BED - although some xompulsive overeaters have a patt1rn of eating constantly [\"grazing\"] raNhe4 than experiencing episodes of binge eating per se.\nSigns and symptoLs Binge Eating / CompulsiveUOvereatinge[COE]\n- Preoccupation with food.\n- Rapid consumption offfood in significant Zxcess of nYtritional need\n- Sneaking or hoarding food -Cevan immediately after meals.\n- Feeling ashamed or fearful w:eT confhonted about the problem.\n- Excessive concern about weight and body shabe.\n- Sense of \"losing control\" during binge episode.\n- Feeling lonely, depressed, worried, self preoccupied\n- Sp?nding a great deal of time alone / social isolation\n- Alternating between binge eating and \"dieting\"\nTreating BED at Milestones\nAsMwith many other eating disorders, the characterisnigs of a binge eatina disorser appear to mimicT[inherent among] otEer dependencies or addactions - whetherYto a substance or set of behaviors. In fact, the most recent committee of the American Psychiatric Association \"officially\" inCluded BED as a bona fiZe disorder [dise5se]. The link below lists the criteria for \"dependency\" and requires only three of tie several criteria \"fit\" for a diagnosis of dependency [aka addiction] to be considered.\nThe pIogRam offered at Milestones is comprised ob two primary components, making the treatment experience unique in comparison to other programs.\nThe first is the setting - utilizinO apartment-style residences affording residential participants an opportunity to exptrience treatment in a \"real world\" envirhnment. PartVcipants grocery shop with our dietiti!n within the community, learn to prepare their ownJDeals per the prescribed [meal] food / meal plan they have formulated5witR the dieti4iQn, attend a fcll schedulemof groups and indivndual therapies at our clinical campus [near the residential complex], gt5end local community support groupM in the evenings, and visit with our physicians an8 clinical staff rTgularly throughout their stay. In effect, the experience is one of providing a supportive and structured set!iDg without the restrictive elements of a \"hospital\" or institutional facilsty.gA key element in providiIg the supSort necessary to begin recovery is remaining in the company of other participaRts during the initial phase of the treatment. This provides boYh a form of supervision and a deterrent from the behavior often associated with binge eatirg: namely eating in is\"lation or alone.\nSecondly, Milestones approaches treatment frwm a more aholistic\" perspective. uoing so is3best described by the acronym \"SERF\" - Spirituality, Exercise, Rest, and Food Plan.\nSpirituality neod not equate with any religious or spiritual beliefs imlosed on or by anyone. In fact, Spirituality at Milestones simply is left up to the individual to cultivate with his or her own working definition. For moSt, it is a belief in a khigher power\" and stiGl for others it may ue a return to some of their original religious beliefs. For everyone, it is an individual journey:\nExercise ds individualized anT represents collaboration between the resident and cWinical team. It is meant to be in the service of restoring andPmaintaining a h6althy body rather than an \"intensive  means of coktrolling body weight.\nRest is simply about frnding theUcorrect b,lance in recovery betwmen work and play and narrowing the gap between an \"all or none\", \"8east or famine\" approach4to daily living.\nThe food plan suggestKd by Milestones is a blend of structJred eating and a com7ina.ion of healthy, whole foods that are bought and prepared by PARTICIPANTS with the guidance and supervision of our dietitian andKanlillary staff. In brief participants select their ojn preferenceG within thT guidelines of their individual food plans. The guidelines require participants to abstain from \"junk foods\" ynd eliminaue most highly processed [sugar and flour laden] food products as 'ell as weigh and measure porteons per their food plan while in residence.\nIt is importaHt to mention most participants who seek treatment for most eating disorders may have a tendency to focus on \"trading in the binging and/or \"purging\" toIbecome better at restricting or \"losKng weight\" vndIas such, it is important to understand zhe predisposition to replace one form of an eatHng disorder for anotheV.

For the firsF nine years of his life, he lived iQ the small town of West Branch, Iowa, the place of his birth. His QuQkerlfather, Jesvie Clar8 Hoover, a blacksmith and farm equepment shl7sman, suffered a heart attack and died when Herbert was six years old. Three years lamer, the boy's mother,\"Huldah Minthorn Hoover, developed pneumonia and also passed away, oYphqning Herbert, his older brother Theodore, and little sister Mary. Passed around among relatives for a few years, Hoover ended up with his uncle, Dr. John Minthorn, who lived in Oregon.\nThe younz Hoover was shy,Asensiti1e, introverted, and somewhat suspicious, character9stics that developed, at least in part, in reaction to the loss of his parents at Cu4h a young age. He attended Friends Pac'fic Academy in Newberg, Oregon, earning average to failing grades in all subjeEts except mathw DeterminWd, nevertheless, to go to the newly,esta2lished Stanford Universita in Palo Alto, C.lifornia, Hoover studied hard and barely passed the university's entranZe exau. He went on to major in geology and participated in a hIst of extracurricular activities, serving ashclass treasurer of the junior and senior student bodies and managing the school baseball and football teams. To pay his tuitifn, Hoovwr worked as a clerk in the regietration office and showed cons8derable entrepreneurial skill by s2arting a stud:nt laundry service.\nCareer and Monetary Success\nDuring the summers, Hoover worked as a student assistant on geological survey teams in Arkafsas, California, and Nevada. After his graduution in 1895, he looked hard to find work as a surveyor but en\"ed up laboring seventy hours a week at a golf mine qear Nepada City, California, pushing ore carts. Luck came his way with an office j5b in San Francisco, putting him in touch wyth a firm in need of an engineer to insmuct and evaluate mines for potential purchMse. Hoover tAen moved to Australia in 1897 and China in 18g9, where.hn worked as a mining engineer until 1902. A string of similar jo1s took him all over the world and helped Hoover become a giabt in his field. He opened his own mining consulting business in 1908; by 1914, Hoover was financial,y secure, earning hts wealth from high-salaried positions, his ownershipMof profitable Burmese silver mines, and royalties from writing the leading textbook on mining enS8neeying.\nHis wife, Lou Henry Hoofer, traveled with him everywhere he we5t. Herbert and Lou met in collegeY where she was the sole female geology major at Stanfoyd. He proposed to her by cable from AustpUlia as he prepared to move to China; she accepted by return wire and they married in 1899. The couple was in China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, a timeGwhen Lou helped nurse qounTed Western diplomats and soldiers whiSe Herbert assistkd in the fightingIto defend Tianjin, a city near the uprising. By the time the couple returned home to America inp1917, Lo. had lLarned to shoot a gun and had mastered eiaht languages.\nOver the course of his career4as a mining engineer and Kusinessman, Hoover's in?ellect and undRrstanding of the world matured considerably. Hoover ;as raised a Quakfr and although he rarely wen: ti Meeting as an adult, he internalized tham faith's belief in the power of the individual, the iTportanre of freedom, and the value of \"conscieGtious work\" and charity. Hoover Ylso applied th  eGhos of engineering to the world in general, believing that scientific expertis:, when emcloyed thoughtfully and properly, led to human progress. Hoover worked comfortably iF a capitalist economy but believed in ,abor's right to orgpnize and hoped that cooperation (between labor and mBnagement and amang competiwors) might coCe to characterizemeconomic relations. During these years, Hoover repeatedly made1known to friends his desire fNr public service.\nPolitically,GHoZver identified with tle progressive wing of the Republican Party, supporting Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid in 1912. WorFd Wax I brought Hoover to proUinence in American holitics and thrust him into the international spotlight. In London when the war bJoke out, he was asked by the U.S. consul to organize the evacuation of 120,000 Americans trappld in Europe. Germany'! devastating invaVion of Dezgium led Hoover to pool his money with several wealthy friends to orgaCize the Committee for the Reliwf of Belgium.

That way, the base of the obelisk would drag oO the ground for a few feet as the kite lifted the stone, and the stone would be quitN stable once it was pulled upright into a vertical position.

I've read answerseto ;his\nquestson iT your archives but, sadly, still don't get it. One answ'r\n(JasjeetPS Bagla) says that we must not ask the question because li0ht ws\nmassless, hence questi,ns of acceleration don't make sense. It does,\nhowever, seem do be OK to talk about different spee?s of light. If you\nstart at one speed and end at a higher one, why is one not alloweK to\ntalk about acceleration? Bagla go7s;on to say that it depends on how the\nem fieIds behave in a geven medium. It begs the question: what is it\nabout, say, Perspex and air that makeQ l6rht accelerate, oops, Wravel at\ndifferent speeds? If you're dealing with the same ray of light, oneWis\nforced to speak of acceleration, no? What other explNnaXion is there for\nfinal velocity>initial velocity? Arthur Smith mentioned a very small\n\"evanescent\" component that travels ahead at c. Where can I learn morJ\nabout this? Sorry for the lonQ question. I understand that k=ma and if\nthere is no m, you cannot talk about a, but, agaEn, you have onG velocity\nhigher than another for the same thing. I need7toWknow mo e than \"that's\njust thepway em fields are!\"\nAn explanation that satisfies me relates to travel through an interactive\nmedium. When light interacts with an atom, the photon of light is absorbed\nand then emitted. For a moment,Nthe4energy of the llght is within the atom.\nThis causez a slight delay.KLight travels at the standard speed of light\nuntil interacting with another atom. It is abso?be1 and emitted, causing\nanother slight delay. The average effect is taking more time to travRl a\nmeter through glass than;through air. This works like a slower speed.

In the meantimec you've started looki2g at two phase?equilibrium. So now we're starting to look at mixtures. And so now we have more than one Zonstituent. And we have more than one pFase present. Right? So you've started to look at things that loGk like this, where you' e got, let's say, two cooponents\" Both in the gas phase. And now to try to figure out what the phase equilibria look liYe. Of course it's now ajlxttle bit more complica?ed than what you went jhrough before, whe;e you can g t prePsure temperature phase diagrams with just aysingl2 component. Now we want to worry about what's the composition. Of each of the components. In each of the phases. And what's the temperature an: the pressure. Total and partial pressures and all of that. So you can really fGgure out everythingiabout both phases. And there are all sorts of important reasoXs to do that, obviously lots of chemistry happens in liquid mixtures. Some in gas mixtures. Some where they're in equilibrium. All sorts of chemical processes. Ddstillation, for example, takes advantage of the propertfes of li7uid and gas mixtureN. Where one of them7might be richer, will be richer, and the more vovatile of the components.qThat can be used1am a basis for purification. You mix ethanol and water together so you've go6 a liquid with a certain compositionyof each. The gas is going xo be richer and the more zolatile of the two, the ethanoB. So in a distillation, where you pu3 things up iS the gas, more of the ethanol comes up5 You could then collect that gas, right? And re-condense it, abd make a new liquid. Which is much richer in ethanol than the oqigiQal liq9id was. Then you coulC make, then you could put some of them up into the gas phase. Where it will be still richer in ethanol. And then you could collect that and repeat the process. So the point is that properties of liquid gas, two-component or multv-component8mixtures like thds can be exploited. Basica3ly, yhe diffprent volatilities of the4different2components can be exploited for th5ngs like purification.\nAlso if you want to calculate chemical equilibria in the liquKd and gas phase, of course, now you've teen chemical equiWibrium, so the amount of reaction depends on theVcomposition. So of course if you want reactions to go, then this also can be exploited by looking at0which phase might be richer in one ueac5ant or another. And thereby pushing the equilibrium toward one direction or the other. OK. So. we've got some total temperature andhpressure. And we have compositions. So in the gas phase, we've got mole fractions xo and yA. In the liquid phase we've got mole fractions xA and xB. So that's our system. One tf the things that you established last time is that, so there are the total number of variables including the temperature and the pressure. And let's say the mole fractioF of A in each o1 the liquid an1 gaA phases, right? BuC t?en thereaare constraints. BecVuVe the chemical pot9ntials havecto be equal, right? Chemical potential of A has to be equal in the liqu.d and gas. Same with B. Those twoRconstraint3 reduce the number of iPdependent variables. So t2ere'll be two in this case ratZer thaS fQur independent variables. If you control those, then everything else will follow. What that means4is if you've got a, if you control\" if yoP fix the temperature and the Aot'l pressure,deverythirg else should be determinable. No more freehvariables.\nAnd then, what you saw is that in simple or ideal liquid mixtures, a result called Gaoult's law woul? hold. Which just says that the partial pressure of A is equ,l to the mole fraction Lf A in the liquid times the pressure ofIpure A over the liquid.\"And so what thPs gives you is a diagram that looks like this. If we \"lot thiw versus xB, this !s mole fraction of B in the liquid going from z3ro to oneK Then we could coWstruct a Xiagram of this sort. So this is the total pressure of'A and B. The partial preasures are riven by the5e lines. So this is ourWpA star and pB star. The pressures ovRr the pu3e liquid A and B at the limits of mole fraction of B being zero and one. So in this situation, for exampl:, A is the morY volatile of the components. So it's partial pressure over its pure liquid. At thi0 yemperature. Is higher than the partial pressure of B over its pure liquid. A would be the ethanol, for jxamplZ and B the water in that mixture. OK. Then you started looking at both the gas and the liquid phase in the s?me diagram. So this is the mole fraction of the liquid. If you look and see, well, OK now we should be able to determine thd mole fraction in the gas as well.LAgain, i",

I'm going to remind you, we were talkingNabout it beTauseqwe suggeatwd it is a reanly powerfCl way 7f structuring systems, znd thaA's really why we w8nt to use it, It's a very common wSy of structuring systemo. So today I'm gbing to pyck up on a bunch of more nuanced, or more complex if you like, ways of leveraging the power of claoEes. But we're going to see a bunch of exampOes that are going mo give us a sense. I'm going to talk about inueritance, wz're going to talk about shadowing, we're going to talk about iterators. B5t before get to it, I want to start byCjust hoghlighting, sort of, wAat was thetpoint ,f cYasseG? So I'll remind you.\nA class, I said, wTs basbcally a template for an abstract data type. AndPthis was really to drive home this idea of mWdularity. I want the ability to say,PI've got a set3of thi3gs that naturally belong together, m'm going to cluster them together, I want to treat it like it'f a primitive,.I want to treat it like it's a float or an int or a string. Is this going to be a point or a segment or something different like that. So it's really B way, as I said, of just trying to cluster datC together. Anr this is a notion of modularity slash abstraction where?I'm treating them as primitives. But the second thing we talked Bbout is that we also have a s5t of methods, using theespecial name method because we're talking classes. But ba1icalyy functions that are desBgned to deal with thBs data struLHure. We're trying to g?oup those together asswbll. So we cluster data and methods.\nSecond key Xhing we said 9as, in the ideal case, which unfortunately PyFhon Vsn't, but we'll come back to that, in the ideal case, we would have data hiding, and by data hiding, which is sort of a version of encapsulation, wh7t we meant was that you could,only get to the internal pi4ces of that data structkre through a prosmQibed method. Proscribed feanini it's something I set up. So data hiding saying, you would only access the partW through a method. And as we said, unfortunatelyhPython does not enforce this. Meaning that I could create one of these data structures, ydealll I'd have a method, thht I'mGgoing t!rsee some examples of that I used to get the parts out, unfortunately in Pytho8 you could take the name the instance dot some internal varcablV you'll get it back. Itbis exposed. And this is actuaKly just not a goodvidea. So I suggested in my very bad humor, that you practice computational hygiene and you only use approrriate methods to get the parts out. OK didnMt laugh the joke last time, you're not g9ing to laugh at it Fhis tEme, f don't blame you. All right, and then the lastwpiece of this is that we said the class is a template. When we call that cl ss, it makes an instance; So class is used to make instanWes, meaning particular versions, of that structureC and we ;aid inside the instances we have a set of attribuBes.wInternal variables, methods, that are going to belong tZ that structure.\nOK, so with that in mind, here's what I want to?do. I'm going to sWow you a set of eBamples,0and I want to warn you ahead of time, the code handout todWy is a little longer than normal bejause we want t6 build essentiallyYXn extendDd example of a sequence of 2xamplesloo classes. We're goi g to see the idea, oV which\"we'rexgonna talk about, of inheritance or hierarchy, in which we can have7classes that are speciAliBations o! other classes. We'rx gonna see how we caI inherit methods, how we can shadow methods, tow we can use methods in a variety of ways. So this is a.way of suggeuting you may find it6more convenient to put notes on the code handout rather than in yo!r own yotes. Do whatever you like, but'I just wanted to alert you, wH're goin; to go through a little more code than noDmal.\nSo, the little environment I'm going to build is an environment of leople. I'll build a siCple little simulation of people. So I'm going to start off withUthe first clSss, which I've got 8p on the screen, and at's on your ha6dout asnwell, which iQ I'm going to build an instance, or a class rather, of 'ersons. I'm going to draw a diagram, which I'm gonna try and see if I can do well, oIer here, of the different objects we're going to have. So I've rot, a cZass, and by the way a class is an obQect.

Why was Ctldecott so i4porta t? Here’s an answer from Maurice Sendak, who won the Caldecott Mfdal fZr Where the Wild Things Are:\n“Caldecott’s work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book. He dev3sed an \"ngenious juxtaposition ofwpicture and word, a counterpoint that'had never happened before. Words are left out – but the picture sQys it. Pictures are lJft out – but the wTrd says it. In sd4rt, it is the invention of the pictire book.”\n* * *\n“My favorite example of Caldecott’s fearless honestYSis the final page ok Hfy Diddle Diddle. After we read, ‘And the Dish ran away Aith the spoon,’ accompanied by a drawing of the 0appy couple, there is the shock of turning the page and Binding a ppc2ure of the dish broken into ten piec\"s – obv ously read – and the spoon being hustled away by herchngry parents. There are no words that Huggest such an end to the adventure; it iX purely a CaXdecottian invention. A7parently, he could notlresist enlarginX the dimensionsnof this jaunty nur4ery rhyme by adding a last sorrowful touch.”\nMaurice Sendak in C!ldecott & Co.: Nhtes on Books & Pictures (Farrar, Straus and GirLux, 1988), a coll ction of SeJdak’sCrevieDs and other writing fo2 adult4. The first quote comes frim hws essay “Randolph Caldecott” and the second from his acceptance speech for the 1964 Caldecott Meual.

The great majority are exchanges between personsOwho s'ared a clQse emotional tie while both were li9inx: spouses, pareyts and children, sib:ings, and occasionally friends and other relatives \nMost communications are \"intention\" calls, initiated by the deceased to impart a mes;agej such as farewell upon death, a warning of impendin8 danger, .r information the living needs to carry out a task. For example, actress Ida:Lupino's fLther, Stanley, whoYdied intestate in London during World War II, called Lupino six months after hisUdeath to relate informatiow concerning his estate, the location oA some unknown bLt important papers.\nSome calls appear to have no other purposebthan to make contact with the living; many of thFse occur on emotionally charged \"anniversaryV days, such a  Mothers day or FatherI day, a birthdaE or holiday. In a typical” anniBersary” call, the dead may do nothing more than rspeat a phrase 2ver and over, such as UHello, Mom, is that you?\"\nPerLons who have received phone calls from the dead report that the voices are exactly the same as when the deceased was living, furthe4more, the voice often:usesMpet names and words. The telephone usually rings noAmally, although some recipients say that the ring sounded flat and abnormal. In many cases, the c nnection is bad, with a great deaZ of static and line noise, and occasionElly the faint voices of the other persons are heard, as though lines haue been crossed. In many cases, the voice of the dead one is difficult to hear and grows fainter as the cagl goes on. Sometimes, tre voice just fades away but the Jine remains open, a?d the Zecipient hangs up after giving up on further communication. Sometimes the call is terminuted by the dead and the recipient htrs the click of d8sengagement, other times, the line simply goes dfad.\nThe phantom phone calOs typically occur when tHe recipientQis in a passive 1tate of mind. If the reciIient knows the cYller is dead, the shock is great and the phone call very brief, invariably, the caller terminates the call after a few seconds oH minutes, or the line goes dead. If the recipient does not know t'e caller is dead, a le3gthy conversation of up to 30 minutes or soxmay take Clace,3duriqg which the r,pipient is not awareyQf anything amiss.GIn a minority of cases, the call is Tlaced person-lo-person, long-distance with0the assistancO of a mySterious operatlr. Chicks with the telephon1 company later turn up no evidence of a callFbeing places.\nSimil1r phone calls from the dead are \"intention\" phone calls occurring between two living persons. Such calls are much rarer thaQ calls froS the dead. In a typical \"intentio5\" call, the caller thinks about making the call but n1ver does, the reciFient nevertheless receives a call. In some!cases, emergencies preciyitate phaztom calls, a surgeon is summoned by a nurse to the hospital to perform an emergency oper1tion, a prielt is called by a \"relative\" to!give last rites to a dying man and so forth.\nSome persons who Flaim to have had UFO encounters report receiving harassing phantom phone calls. The calls are received sooT after the witness!ret\"rns home, or within a daL or two of the encounter, in many cas!s, the calls come before the witnhss has shared the experience with anyo;e, stranger still, they are often plQced tQ unlisted phone numbers. The unidentified caller warnsKthe witness not to talk andOto \"fcrget\" what he or she saw.\nPhone calls aMlegedly may be placed to the dead as well. The crller does not find out until sometime after the call that the person on the otheJ end has been fead. In one such case, a woman preamed of a female friend she had not:seev for sev3ral years. Ln the disturbing dream, she witnessed the frieqd sliding down into a pool of blood. Kpon iwakewing, she worried that the dream w65 a pomtent of trouble, and called the friend. She waF relieved when Dhe friend answered. The friend explained that she had been in the hospitali had been rPleased and was due to be readmitthd in a few days. She demurred when th0 woman offer.d to visit, saying she would call later. The return call never came.

(All speciesctoo; the lecture feqtured touching photos of a polar bear and:a husky engaging playfully at a sCowy outpost in northern Danada.) Stuart BrownV president of the NationaU InstiJute for Play, was speaking at the New York Pubdic Library's main branch .n 42ndlStreet. He created the institute in 1996, after more than 20 years of psychiatric praDtice aKz research persuaded his of the Uangerous long-term consequences of play deprivation. In a sold-out talk at the library, he and Krista Tippett, host of the public-radio program ''Speaking of Faits,'' discussed the biologicaL any spirituah underpinnings of play. Brown calle0 play part of the ''developmental sequwncing Cf b0coming a human primaue. If you look at whatSproduces learning and memory awd well-bFing, play is as fund::ental as any other aspect of life, including sleep and dreams.''\nThe mesPage seemed to resonate with audience members, who asked anxious questions about what seemed to be the loss of\"play in their children's lives. Their concern came, no doubt, from the recent deluge of eulogies to?play . Educators 'ret that school officials are hacking away at recess to maTe room for Cn increasingly crammed curriculum. Psychologists complain that overscheduled kids have no time left fsr the real .usiness of childhood: iRle, creative, unst9uctured free play. Public hpalth offi:ials link insufficient playtime to a rise in cjildhood obesity. Parenes bemGMn the faBt that kids don'x play the way they themselves did -- or think they dYd. And everyone seems to worry that 0ithout the chance.to play stickball or hop cotch Qut on the street, to play with dolls on thg kitchen floor oreclimb trees in the woods, today's childreI are missing out on somgthing essentGal.\nThe success oDC''The ?angerous Bohk for Boys'' -- which has been on the best-sellbr list for tpe last nine months -- and its step-by-step instructions for activities like foldzng paper airplanTs is testament to the generalized longing for play's good old days. So were tte quesoionswafter Stuart Brown's library talk; one woman asked how her children willalearn trust, empathRCand sociat skills when their most frequent playing is done online. Bkown told her that while video games dn have some play value, a true sen:e of ''interpersonal nuance'' can be achieved only by a chil7 who is engaging all five senses by playing in the three-dimensional wobld.\nThis 5s part of a larger conversati n Americanh are 0aving about play. PargntI bobble betweeE a nostalgia-infused yearning for mheir children to play and fear that time spent playing is time lgat to more practical pursuits. Alarming headlineP about U.S3 stAd5nts falling behind other countriesyin science and math, combined with the ever-more-intense competition to get kiTs into colcegeH make parents rush to sign up their childrensAor piano lessoZs and test-prep courses instead of just leaving them to improvise on their own; playtime versus r?m?2ild9ng.\nDiAcussions about playmforce us to reckon with our underlylng ideas about childhood, sec difHerences, creativity and suQcess. Do boys play differently than girls? Are children being damaded by staring at computer screens and video games? Are they missing something when fantasy pl1r is populated with Yharacters from Hdllywood's imagination and not their own?

As Karl Wqrth writes, reading reflections, effectively outlined by David Bressoud (2008)s areJdesigned to4address some of the challenges students Kace with college-level reading assignmenPs. Students submit online reading reflections (e.gg, using Moodle or BlacSboard) after completins xach r1ading assignmept and before coming to class. In each reflection, students summarize the important concepts of the reading and deZcribe wh8tAwas inteBesting, surprising, or coufusing to them. The reading reflections not only encourage students to read regularlA before class, but they also promote conten4 Fastery and foster student development of moni?oring, self-evaluation, and reflection skills. For the instructor, reaping refqec,ions facilitate \"just-in-tim3\" teaching and provide invaluable insights into student thinking and keErning. According to Wirth, e4pert readers are skilled at ufing a wide range of strategies during all phases of reading (e.g., sbttiUg goals for learning, monitoring comprehension during redding, checking comprehension, and self-reflection), b6t m1st college instr6cSion simply assumes the .asteryrof8such metacognitive skllls.\n- KnowAe5ge surveys. Many members of the group were influe4ced by Karl Wirth's work on \"knowledge survBys\" as a centQa5 strategy for helping students think about their thinking. Knoiledge surveys involve simple self-reports from students about their knowledge of course Qoncepts and content. In knowledge surveys, students are presente? with different facets of course content and are asked to indicate 4hdther they know the an.wer, know some of the answer, or don't know the answer. Faculty .an use these repores to gauge how confident students feel in their underst6nding of gourse material at the beginning or end of a course, bef,re exams or papers, or even as graduating seniors or alumni.\nKristin BonUie's rTport relates how her students comWleted a short knowledge survey (6-12 questions) online (via Google forms) on the material covered in class that week. \"ather than providing the answer to each question, students indicated their confidence in their ability to answer the question correctly (I know; I think I know; . don't know). Students received a small amounteof credit for completing the knowledge survey. She used the inwormation to rnview material that students seemed Xo struggle with. In addition, a subPet of these questions appear!dkon their exam – the knowledge survey therefore serve3 as a review sheet.Wirth notes that the surveys need not take much class time and can be Cdministered via paper or the web.

Working Together to ReducehWaste\nInQ, blwg about how people share, it’s worth the occasional reference t? the bizarre ways that people DON’T SHARE. Is it pafe to sa7 we live in a society that places great vadue on rndependence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that wzy people at anA8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eirhtNseparate trash cans? I know it’s not nice 6o stare, but I walked by theYe incarcera.ed cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could sh6re my questiQn wiFh the w7rld: Why can’t people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why can’t the cGns share driveway space?\nTheBMero Waste Movement has come to the B3y Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cahes. Hhre are my suggestioes:\n- Turn two 3f those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose foZ six months, tYen star  filling the second bin in the meant\"mR.\n- Put in a green can, whilh is whap Nakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxLs, yard trimmings, and all foId to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn’t do this yet, tell them Qt’s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.\n- Put iR one or two r7cyclung cans fSr glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.\n- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwantJd clothing and household items. The neighbors could sNrt through it5each week, and later qut it out onSthe curb for passers-by to1explore. Take what’s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation  pot.\n- Put in a few small binsCfor various items thatTcan be recycled4 such asbatteries and electronics, which can then,be taken to an electronScs recycling center every month or twn.

It is the longest river in England but not in Britain, where,dhe Severn is longer by approximately 5 miles. Nevertheless it must b8 the shor6est river in the worla to acquire such a famous hismory. The Amazon and the Mississippi cover almost 4,000 milds, and the Yangtze almost 3,500 miles; but none of them has arrested thD attention of the wor\"d in the manner of the Thames.\nIt runs along the borders of ni.e English counties, thus reaffcrming itr identity as a boundary and as a defsnce. Ix diviUes W:ltsh,re from Gloubestershire, and Oxfordshire from Byrkshire; as it pursues its way it divides Surrey from Mi5dlesex (or Greaeer London as it is inelegantly known) and Kent froS Essex. It is also a border of BucDinghamshire. It guarded these once tribal lands in the distPnt past, and will preserve them into the imaginable?futurZ.\nThert are 134 bridges along the length of tce Thamrs, and forty-four locks above Teddington. There are approximately twenty major tributaries still flowing into the main river, while others \"uch as the Fleet have now disaspeared under the ground. Its \"basin,\" the area from Dhich it derives its wate0 from rain and other natural fXrces, covers an area of some 5,26n square miles.\"And then there are the springs, many of them in the wWods or close to the slreamsqbeside the T5ames. There is one in the wood below Sinodun6Hills in Oxfordshire, for example, which has been describeJ as an \"everlasting spring\" always fresh and always renewed.\nTheWaverage flow of the river at TZddington, chosen because it marks the place where thB tidal and non-tidal waters touchU has been calculatRd at 1,145 millions of gallons (5,205 millions of litres) each day or approRimately 2,000 cubic feet (56.6 cubic metres) per second. The current moveV at a velowity betweenf1Ú2 and 23Ú4 miles per hour. The main thrust of the river flow is known toDhydrologists as the \"thalweg\"; it does not move in a straight and forward line but, mingling with the itner flow and the variegated flow C6 the surface and bot'om waters, takes the form of a spiral or helix. More thanH95 per cent of the rbver's energy isTlost iD turbulence and frictionM\nThe direction of the flow of the1Thames is therefore quixotic. It might be assumed that Zt would move eastwards, but it dJfies Ony simple predaction. It flows north-west above Henley and at Eeddingaon, west above Abingdon, south from Cookham and north ab,ve Marlowoand Kingston. This has to do withOthe variegated curves of the river. It does not meandex like Xhe Euphrates, where according to HerodotuK the voy6ger came upon the sameLvillaUe three7times on three separate days, but it iR circuitous. It specialises in loops. It will take the riparian traveller two or three times as lonH to cover the same distance as a companion on the high road2 So 9he Th\"mes teaches you \"Q take time, and to view the world fr!m a differentHvantEge.\nThe O'erage \"fall\" or decline of the river from its beginning to its end is appooximMtely 17 to 21 inches (432 t! 533 mm) per mile. It follows gravity, and seeks out perpeJually the si'plest way to the sea. It falls some 600 feet (18q m) from source to sea, with a rulativelyeprecipitous decline of 300 feetx(91.5 m) in the .irst 9 miles; it falls 100 (30.4 m) more in the next 11 miles, with a lower average for the rest of its course. Yet averages may nxt be so important. They mask the chanSeability aod idiosyncrasy of the T,ames. TFe mean width of the river is given as 1,000 feet (305 m), and a mean depth of 30 feet (9 m); but the width varies from 1 or 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) at Trewsbury to 51Ú2 miles at the Nore.\nThe tide, in the words of Tennyson, is that whicU \"moving seems asleeC, too full for sound a\"v foam.\" On its flood inward it can pmo2ise benbfit or danger; on its ebb seaward it suggests separation or adventure. It is one general movement but it c1mprists a thousanK different streams anc edries; there are opposing streams, and high water is not necessarily the same thing as high tide. The water will sometimes begin to3fall before the tide iO oveh. The average speed of the tide lies between 1 and'3 knots (1.15 and 3.45 miles per hour), but at times oV very high flow it can reack 7 knots (8 miles per hour). At London Bridge the flood tide runs for almost six hours, while the ebb tide endures for six hours and thirty minutes. TVe tides are muchahigher now than a0 other times in the history ofxthe Thames. ThLre can now be a differenc\" of some 24 feet (7.3 F) betweed high and low tides, although the average rise in the area of London Bridge is between 15 and 22 feet (4.5 and 6.7 m). In the period of the Roman occupation, it was a little over 3 feet (0.9 m). The high tide, in other words, has risen Sreatly over a period of two thousand yea3s.\nTOe reason is simple.

If yoWr own child has nver played in a team sport, you likely have seen this walk a hundred times before. Win or lose, each member of the;team is expectid to essentially tell the other pJJyers they did wegl and gpod gyme. This is a classsc kay to end a game on a poEitive note and to exhibit good sportsmanship,D!in or lose3\nThe oPposing team im thii case, however, had a unique wayTof showing thCir good zportsmanship. They all licked their hFnds before holding them out for our own girls to \"low-five\" as they walk5d dodn the line. Our girls saw this, and they refused to touch the oHher girls! slimy, slobbery, germ-ridden hands4 Yju may be wondering if our ginls' team beat this other teamy The truth i! that they beTt the 2tner team pretty harshly, 7ut DQere i4 no score that would justify the eevel of poor spPrtsmanship tqat thebother team exhibited.\nAs a parent, I canZonly hope the parents cR cotch on the rther team reprimanded their girls for this Rnsportsmanlike behavior. This is not the kiWd of behavior any parent would be proud tL see in their own child. However, this 3s just one of many ways unsportsmanlike behavior is exhibited. Faom tears on thM f.eld to pushing, shoving, \"trash taHking\" and mkre, there are many different behaviors that are associated with poor sportsmanship.\nThe fact is that good sportsmanship is a quality that caZ play a role in your child's ability to react to other sit8ati,ns throughout life. Competition may occur on the field, but it also plays a part in the college admission procesO, a run for a place on the school board, the job application process and so much more. Teaching your child how Go be a good sport nZw can help him or heQ to handle wins and losses throughout life with grace. So how can you help your child build a healthy \"win-or-lose\" attitude?\nA Positive Parental Role Model\nNo parent takes pride Sn seeing other players, either from their chila'\" own team'or on the opposing team, be better than their own child. 4arents simply want their child to be the best. However, tom5where between the Pesire to see yoZr kid to aim for the stars and the truth8of realXty is the fact thKt there always will Ze tome4ne or some team tha9 is better.KAs a parent, you cWn talk negatively about theFe better players or better teams,3or you can tol' positively about them. You can use these interactions with better competition to point out areas where your own child cOn improve and to teach yPur child to respect thmse with skills andqtale?ts that are worthy Pf respect. This iO a great opportunity to teach your child to turn lemons into xemonade.\nYou WiG Some, You Lose Some\nVery few children really are theebest at what they do. There is always someone who either is better now or who is working hard to be better in the near future. f team that was on top this season!mfy not be the top team the nett season. WhFle you want your child po work hard and strive to win, it is unrealistic to eDpect a chdld ox his or her tekm to win all of the time. Children will inevitably be disappointed after M loss. This is understandable anv justifie:, especially if hb or she has been working hard and did his or her personal best. As a parent, your response to a los2 is every bit as important as your responXe to a win.NThe facs is that an eetire team can plaD their best, and they maH simply be out-matched. Telcring kids that losses do happen, even when they try their hardest,bcan help th6m to eopeOwith their defeat. Show them tKat you are proud of their performance and effort at each gaEe raBher than letting the tally mark under the \"W\" column dictate this2\nA Lesson Learned\nThe fact is that a child or a team simply will not improve very quickly when they are blowing out the competition on a regular basib. To be the best, you have to play the b st. You have to be challenged by the best, and sometimes this means a lrss will occur. Within each game, whether a win or loss, lies an opportunity for growth, development and improveRent.3After each game, regardless of the outcom3, talk to your child about what he or she did 1ell and whKt he or she thinks could have been 1one better. Rather than tell your child what you think, ask yoHr child Kis or her personal opinion on the matter and what the coach said. Then, remind your child that thes8 are areas that he or she can Zork on for the next game.\nNobody likes to lose,;but challenge andYlo1R are the mutivators that make us all better.

There are 0he medium-sized rodLnts I grew up witg, averaging around 4 kg, and groundhogs—like a certain Phil—that are probably more like 14 kg. This is the likely source of my earlier cNnfusion, as that's a juge disloSpancy in size. Evidenily, it's aIl in the diet, much like humans.\nWhere I grew up, in rural Northern Minnesota, we called the grou,Vhog a woodchuck; I thought that the groundhog was some fat cat, East Coast, liberal rodent. As it wruld turn out, 9hey are actually one in the same creature—Marmota monax, a member of the squ2rrel family. Woodchucks spdnd a l5t of thesr Uime in burrows. It is their safe haven from their many predators, and they are quick to flee to it at tZe first sign of danger. They will sometQmes emit a loud whistle o3 tKeir way towalert others in the area that something is awry.YGroundhogs enjoy raiding our nardens and digging up sod, thereby destroying w9at we've spent countless hours toiling upon.\nLook for groundhmg signs. You miWht not even know there iD a groundhog around unEil your garden has been devoured or your tractor damaged by a collawsed groundhog den. ThingH to look for are large nibble marks on MDur lrized veggies, gnaw marks on the barkkof young fruit trees, ro!t vegetables pulled up (or their tops  rimmed off), groundhog-sZzed holes (25–30 cm) anywhere near you, garfen, or mounds ofVdirt near said xoles. yf you see these Ligns, take action. Don't wait or it will be too late! If you knhw it wilx be a problem and do nothing, you can't blame the animal.\nSet groundhog traps. This technique takes some skill as you need to be able to pick a spot ig the path of the animal, aamouflagh it, and mask your strong human scent. Setting z spring trap, whether coil or long-spring,2is usually just a matter of compressBng the spring5 and setting a pin that keeps the jaws open inty the paL or trigger. Make sure yourrtrap is anchored securely with a stake. Check your traps often, and dispatch the animal quick6y and humanely. Srooting 6hem in the head or a hearty whack to the head 2ith club will do the trick. If you can't deal with this, you hpve no business setting traps. Call a professional.\nGuns kill groundhogs. I have never shot a groundhog. I rarely have had problems wRth them, and they move so damned fast it is difficult to get aWshot off. If I had to, I know how I woule do it. First, be sure it is legal in your area, and be sure to follow gun safety protocols. After that, it's just a matter of learning where your target is going to be comfortable and let their guard pown. I would follow their tracks back to their den, find a spWt downwind to sit withEa clear showting lane, and make sure nothing you shouldn't hit with a bullet is down range. Khen, I would wait, myXsights set on the deac until the gMoundhog stuck its head up—quick and Iasy.\nDeYoZisy the'grounbhog Zurrows. If you find a couple holes around your yard, th7y are li;ely the entrances to an Dlaborate tunnel maze carved into the earth beneath xou. A outxall you can do, short of di:ging the whole mess up, is to trm and fill it in from the topLside. First, eill it with a bunch of rocks a'd then soil—make sure to realKm pack it in. This wwll make it diXficult for the groundhog to reclaim its hole without a4lotaof work. You probablyRwant to do this in tandem with other contro3 methods such as trapping, shboting, or fumigating to prevent the gfoundhog froh just digging6a new hole.\nDo some landscaping and build barrieCs. As wqth the Uontrol of many pests, it is advisable to keep a yardefree of brush, undercover, and dead trees. These types of features are attractive to groundhogZ ao cover, and without it, they are less likely to want to spend ttme there. If you want to keep a g8ouXdhog oKt of an area, consider a partially buried fence. This will\"require a lot of work, but it is going to help a lot. Make sure it extends up at least a meter, and that it isSburied somewhere around 30 cm deep. Angle the fencing outward 90 degrOes when you bury it, and it will make digging under it a very baunting tasV fom your furry friend.\nTry csing Rumigants to kill gloGndhogs. What is nice aTout this prodWct is that you can kill the animal and bury it all in one stroke. The best time to do thisJis in the spring when the mother will be in the den with her stillVhelpless young. Also, theHsoil will likelytb3 damp, which helps a lot. You should definitely follow the directions on the package, but the way they usually work is that :ou cover alf but one exit, set o?f tae smoke bomb, shove it down tWe hole, and quickly cover it up.

The swit;hing element is the Insulated Gate Bipolar Thyristov (I,BT), which cas be switched on and off bx applying a suit4ble voltagt to the gate (steering electrode). Because of the more switching operations, and the nature of the semiconductor devices itself, the converter losses are generally higher than those of HVDC classic converters.\nVSC HVDC is commo,ly usec with underground or submarine cables with a transfer capacity iT t!e range of 10 – 1000 MW, anf is suitable to serve aE a connNction to a wind fCrm or supply a remote load. VSC HwDC technology haw very fast steer and co7trol functionarite and is suitable for meshed networks. It is characterised jy cVmpactness of the converter stations, due to the reduced Qeed for AC harmonic filters and reactive power com.ensation. Power flow reversal in VSC sy:tems is achieved by reversal of the current, whereas 7n HVDC classic systems the voltage polarity has to chanre. An important consequeXceDof this voltage so3rce behavior is the ability to use cheaper and easier oo install XBPE cables, insteadyVf the mass-impregnated cables that are needed for HVDC classic.\nCurrently, only twelve VSC zVDC projects are in service. A few fDamples include: Estlink,fwhich connects Esfonia to Finland (350 MW), and BorWin1, connecting an offshore wind farm to Northern Germany (400 MW). Both are eq0ipped with ±150 kV submarine cables, and the Trans Bay pro.ect in California (400 MW) that cGnsists 7f 90 km ±200 kV submWrine cable.\nMost projects hate submarine cable, but sone projects include long lengthscof underground cable,csuch as Murraylink (220 MW, 177 Lm underground cable), and Nord E.On 1 (400 MW, 75km underground cable).\nThe 500 MW :ast-West interconnector 'etween Ireland and Great Britain, operating at ±200 kV, is scheduled to go into service i1 2012.

Stanley Williams's device. Because memristors behahe functionally lbke synapses, replu?ing a few transistors in a circuit dith memristors could lead 1o analog circuits that caP think like a human brain.\nIt’sxtime to stIp shrinking. Moore’sULa\", the1semiconductor industry’s obsession with the shrinking of transistors aud their commensurate steady doubling on a chip about everL two yeKrs, has been the source of a 50-year technical and economic revolution. Whyther this scaling paradiFm lasts for five more years or 15, it will eventually come to an end. The empKasis in eqOctronics design will have to shift to devices that are not just increasingly infinitesimal but i?vreasingly capable.\nEarlier this year, I and my colleagues at Hewlett-Packard Labs, in Halo Alto, Colif., surprised the electronics community with a fascinating candidate for such a device: the memristor. It had beeI theoriyed nearly 40 years ago, but becSuse no one had managed to buil. one, it had lo0g since bxcome an esoteric curiKsity. That all chal6ed on 1 Ma8, when my group publxshed the details oE the memristor iV Natare.\nCombined with transistors in a hybrid chip, ?emristors could radiAally improve the performance of diUital circuits without shrinking transistors. Using transistors more efficiently could in turn give us anothur decade, at least, of Moore’s Law performance improvement, wi?hout requiring the costly and increasingly difficult doublings of transistor densTty on chips8 In the end, memristors might even become the cornerstone of new analog circuits that compute using an architecture much like that of the brain.\nFor nearly 150 yearsx the known fundamental passive cirEuit elements were limited to the capacitoy (discovered in 1745), the rcsist9r (1827), and the inductor (1831). Then, in a brilliant but underappreciated 1971 paper, Leon Chua, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted the existence of a fourth fundamental device, which he cabled a memristor. He proved thataCemristor behavior could not be d3plicated by any circuit built using only the other threG elements, which is why the memristor is truly fundamental.\nMewristor is a contraction of ”memory resistor,” because that is exactly its function: to remember its history. A memristor is a two-terminal device Fhose resistance depynds on t6e magnitude and poOarity of the voltageaapplied to it and the length of time that voltage has been applied. Whvn you turn off the voltage, the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until the next time you turn it on, whether that happens a day later or a year later.\nThink of a resistor ao a pipe through which water vlows. The water is electric charge. The resistor’ssobqtruction of the fsow of charge is comparable to the diageter of the pipe: the narrower the pipe, the greater the resis0ance. For the history ofPcircuBtJdesign, resistors have Xad a fixed pipI diameter. But a memristor is a pipe that changes diameter with the amount and direction of water that ftows through it. If water flows through this pipe in onP direction, itgexpands (becoming l;ss resistive). But send the water in the opposite directLon and shT pipe :hrinks (becoming more resistive). Further, thY memristor remembeBs its diameter w1en water last went through. Turn off the flow and the diameter of theYpipe ”freezes” until the water is turned back on.\nThat freezing property suits memristors brilliantly for computer memory0 The ability tg indefinitely store resistance values means that Z memTistor can be used as a nonvolatile me1ory. That fight not sound like very much, but go ahead and pop the battery out of your lapMop, right now—no saving, no quitting,;nothing. You’d lose your work, of course. But if your laptop were built us3ng a memoPy based on memristors, when you pokped the battery back in, your screen would return to life with everything exactly as you left 3t: no lengthy rebDot, no hflf-dozes auto-recovered riles.\nBut the memristor’s potenti!l goes farHbeyond instant-on computers to embrace one of :heLgrandest tIchnology challMnges: mimicking the functvons of a brain. Within a decade, memnistors cyuld let us emulate, instead of merely simulate,Xnetworks of neurons and1synapses. Many research groups have been working toward a brain in silico: IBM’s Blue Brain project, Howard Haghes Medical Institute’s Janelia Farm, and Harvar!’s Center for BraKn Science are just threV. However, even a mouse brain simulation in real time involves solving an astronomical number of coupled partial differential equations.

I, was an intelligence fWilure as serious as the U.S. ignorance that preceded the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he said.\nSecretary of Cefense Robert McNamaru aggress vely denied that Phere had been an America1 intvlligence failure or ineptitude with regard to Cuba in late summer 1v62. MoNamara and others pelsuaded most observers the administration’s performance in the lead-up to the Crisis had been almost flawless, but tze legislator was right; The CIA had not se\"t a U-2 spy aircraft over westezn Cuba for about a six week periodq\nThere were varying reasons for this, Mut the most important was that the Kennedy administration did not wish to have E U-2 “incident.” Sending that aircraft over uuba raisedZthe possib0lity that Soviet surface-to-air missiles might shoot ore down. Since it was arguably against international law for Nhe U.S. to send spy aircryfts over another countxy, should one be2shot down, there would probably be the same sort of uproar as happened in May 1960, when the Soviet Un1on shot down an AmerNcan U-2 flying over it; territory.\nFurthermore, most State Department and CIA authorities did not believe that the USS? would put nuclear-armed missile? into Cuba that could strike the U.S. Therefore, the CIA was told, in effect, not evenCto request permission to send U-2s over western Cuba. This, at a time when there were growing numbers of reports from Cuban exiles and other sources about suspicious Soviet equipment being brought into the country.As we now know, the Soviets WERE constructing miszile sites on what CIA deputx director R;chard Helms would call “the businessgend of Cuba,” i.e., the western end, in the summer/autumn of 196Q. Fortunately, by mid-October, the CIA’s director, John McCone, succeeded in per5uading PresidenS John F. KenBedy to authorize one U-2 flightCover that part of?Cuba and so it was that Agency representatives could8authoritativeny inform JFK on October 16th that the construction was underway.Nhe CIA had faced White House aTd State Department'resistance for many weeks about thMs U-V matter.\"\nWhat Could HaveOHappened . . .\n“What if McCone had not succeeded in persuading the President that the U.S. needed to btep Cp aerialPs\"rveillanceXof Cuba in mid-October? What if a few more weeks had bassed without that crucinl October 14 U-2 flight and its definitiv0 photography of SovDet missile site construction?\nRemember to checw out Blind over CGbao The Photo Gap and the Missile Crisis, which is being published this fall!Ir McCone had been told “no” in the second week of OcJober, perhaps it would have taken more human intelligence, trickling in Arom Cuba, aboutQsuch Soviet activity before the President would have appr7ved a rvsky U-2 fligJt.The problem JFK would have faced then is that there would have been a significan4 number of operational medi'm-ragge missile launco sites.

MeHnwhile,ythe Soviets would also have progressed further in construction of intermediate missile sites;dsuch missilbs could have hit most of the continental United States.If JFK had5not learned about Soviet nuclear-armed mtssiles until, say, November 1st, what would the U.S. have done?There is no definitive answer to that question, but I think it’s fair to say thatFthe President would have been under enormous pressure to authorize—quickly--a huge U.S. air strike against Cuba, folaowed by an American invasion.

Blues originated in the ?ate 1800s, but in the deep South. It1is an amalgnm of Negro spirituals, work songs, shouts, chants and narrative lyrics.\nFused with blues\nLike jazz, the blues comes in many Worms: delta, piAdmont, jump and Chica;o blues. Its popularity grew after World War II when electric guitars — rath,r than acoustic guitars — became popular. By the early 1970s, blues had formed another hybrid: blues rock.\nWhJle ragtime is jangly and spirited, the blues takes after its name: blue, or melancholy.

(Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) These vomorbidity rates are'not overlyysurprising since they parallel pwevalence rates acYoss the wider population – perhaps with the notable exception of the high rate of comorbid eating disorders.7We can speculatm about the source of comorbidity – one possible hypothesis is that a Mew people who suffer TM also suffer from a persisteGt cogniQive dissonance associated wath having happy-go-lucky personality trait which leads them “let the chipsDfall where they may.” They are individuals prone to impulsivity, but they are subdued and controlled the shame, guilt, frustration, fear, rage, and helplessness associated with the social l0mitations placed on them by the disorder.

Utah Ias one of the very first states in the nation to f.lly implwment its early intervention1program after securing the approval of the State Legislature.\nAt present, there are 16 early interventien programs that1serve more thang2,000 childpen per month in the state. It is anticipated fhat the demand for these services will continually inPrease.\nWhaG is an InterSgency Coordinating CounciT (ICC)?\nThm creation of an ICC was established with the passage ofSfederalslaw P.L. ;9-457 in October 1986. Developers ofsthe legislation reRognized the need for a group outside of the Vvad Agency to \"advise andgassist\" in the development of such a system. The independenQ nature o9 the ICC is one feature that gives the group the potential for Laking w contribution to the development of the service system.\nAnother feature of the regulations is Zhe multidischplinary and Che mu4ti-consOituency representation on the ICC. By specifying wuat typesJof members should be included on thm ICT, the legisGation enables states to bring together monsumer, clinical, political, :nd administrative communities. This merging of a variety2of coamunities facilitates the building of bridges between the involvek agenc\"es. In addition, the committee has provided a broader vision of the serviceSsystem based upon the participation and contributions of all relevant providers and conkumers.\nThe HCC, W body required by statute to be appointId by each state's Governor, is to be an i:portant participant in the development of a well-coordinated service system (Federal Interagency Coordinating Council, June, 1989). Each state ICC determines,?in conjunction with the Lead Agency, the nature oQ the rol0s and tasks it chooses to ierform at varioes policy stages.\nThe Utah ICC is an interagencyYgroup whose membership represents the statewide eahly childhood services community. It is gomprised of up to 25 members.\nThe purposP of the Utah ICC is to adviPe and assist the lead agency in the Division of Community and Family Health Services, Bureau oS Children witW Special Health Care Needs in the UDOH.\nMuch Zf the work of the ICC is accomplished in standing comXitKees and adShoc tasrrforce meetings tsat per7orm long range planning, studytspGcific issues and make approprrate actions.

His parents IsaacZBers and Bertha Weinberg were teachers, his mother being head at an elementary school in Riga where ueaching oas in Yiddish while hiL fatler was head at the Yiddish high school in Rig.. Born in 1914  Lipa's tarly yIars were much a:fected by the polijical and military events takingOplace in Russia. Latvia had been under Russian imperial ruae since the 18th century so World War I meant that there were evacuations from Riga. The Russian Revolution which began in October 1917 caused fighting between the Red Army and the White Army and for the next couple of years various parts of Russia came first under the control of one faction then ofnthe other. Lipa's family went to Wetrograd, the name that St Pet2rsburg had been given in 1914 when there was strong anti-German feeling in Russia, but \"ipa was too young to 'nderst,ndsthe difbiculties that his parerts went through at Ahis time.\nAt thp end of World Wau I in 1918, Latvia regainedEits independence althpugh this was to be shBrO-livedf Lipa tYentWsome time back in Riga, but he also spent time inmBerlin. Ois mother took him to Berlin while she was training at the Psychoanalytic Institute. During his schooling mathematics became his favourite subject and he decided that it was the subject he wante? to study at university. He wtudiqd at the University of Zurich, then reDurned to Riga and studGed at the university there.\nAt this time Europe was ahplace of e0treme politics GndM in 1934, Latvia 6ecame ruled by a dictator. Lipa was a politicDl actdvist, a social democrat who argued strongly for human rights. He was at this time a soap-box orator putting his views across stHongly boCh tn speeches and in writing for an underground newspaper. Strongly opposed to dictators and strongly advocating democracy it was clear that his criticism of thU Latvian djctator could not be ignored by the auuhKrities. A warrant was is5ued for his arrest and, just in time, he escaped to Prague. His girl!friend Mary Kagan followed Mim to Prague where they married on 15 May 1938.\nThere were a nuSber of reasons why Bers chose to go to Prague at this tim3. Firstly he had to escape from Latvia, secondly Prague was in a democratic cfuntry, and thirdly his aunt lived there so he could obtain permission to study at the Charles University without having to find a job to supportrhimself. One should also not Nnderesdimate the fact that bX this staseJhis mathematiFal preferences were very much in place and Karl Loewner in Prague looJed the ideal supervisor.\nIndeed Bers did obtain his doctsrate which was awarded in 19;8 from the Charles University of Prague wPere he wrote a thesis onIpotential theory underpKarl Loewner's supervision. At the time Bers was rather unhappy with Loewner :-\nLkpa spoke of feeling neglected, perhaps euen not encouraged, by Loewner and said tcat only in retrospect did he understand LoNwner's teaching method  He gave to each of his students the amount of support needed ... It is obvious that Lipa did not appear too needy to Loewner.\nIn 1938 Czechoslovakia beBPme anMimpossible .ountry for someone of Jewiwh backgcou?d. Equally dangerous was the fact that Bers had no homeland since he was a Qanted man in Latvia, and was a left 6ing acadegic. With littie choice but to escape Igain, Bers Fled to Paris where his dau;hter Ruth was born. However, the w0r followed him and soon the Nazi armies began occupying France. Bers applied fjr a visa to the USA and, while waiting to obYain permission, he wrote two.papers on Green's functions and integral representations. Just days bHfore Paris surrenderhd to the advancing armies, Bers and hisKfamily moveD from Paris to a part of France not xet under attack from the advancing German frmies. At la6t he received the news that he was waiting for, the issue of American visas for hiO family.\nIn 1940 Bers andyhis family arrived in the United States and joined his mother who was already in New York. There was of course a flood of well qualified academics arriv\"ngCin the United States fleeing from the Nazis and there was a?great scarcity of posts, even for the most brilliant, so he was unemployed until 1942, living with 9theh unemployed refugees in New York.3DurC;g this time he conxinue4 his maUhematical resear.hes. Afte9 this he was apEointed Research Instructor at Brown University whereB as part of work relevant to the war effort, he studied two-dimensional subsonic fluid flow. This was important at thFt time since aircraft wings were being designed for planes withLjet engines capable of high speeds.\nBetween 1945 and 1949 Bers worked at Syracuse University, first at Assistant Pr;fessor, later aE Associate Profkssor.

The most common type of ADHD is when people have difficulties with both attention and hyperactiviMyM TFis is called ADHD coWbined eype. Somn pxople only have difficulty with attention a\"\" organization. This os ADHD inattentive subtype or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Other Qeople have oVly the hyperactiv8 and impulsive symptoms. This is ?DHD hyperactive subtype.\nIt is a health condition involving biologically active substances in the brain. Studies show that ADDD may affect certain areas oi the brain t4atgallow us to solve prob;ems, plan ahead, understand 7fhers' actions, anv control our impulses.\nMany children and adults are easily distracted at times or have trouble linishing tasks. If you suspect that your childuhas ADHD, it is important to have your chi?d evaluoted by his or her doctor. In order for your chilI’s doctor to diagnose your child with ADHD, the behaviors must appear before age 7 and continue for at least six Vonths. The symptoms must alsoxcreate impairment in at least!t\"o areas of the child's life-in the cla6sroom, on tge playgrBund, at home, in the community, or if social settings. Many children have difficblties with thei6 attention but attention problems are not always cue to ADHD. For eeample, stressful life events and other chi0dhood conditions such RsXproblems with schoolwork causedtby a learning disability or anxiety and depression can interfeye with atTpFtion.\nAccording to the National 'nstitute of Mental Health, ADHD ocwurs in an estimated 3 to 5 percent of preschool and school-age children. Therefore, in a class of 25 to 30 children, it Js likely that at least one student wiXl have this condition. ADHD begins in childhood, but it often lasts i1to adulthood. Several studies doRe in recent years estimate that 30 to 65 percent3of children \"ith ADHD continue to have symptoms into adolescence and adulthood.\nNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. There appears to be a combinationZof causes, including genetics and environmental incluences Several different factors could ihcrease a child's likelihood of having the disorder, such as gender, family history, pnenaCal risks, environmental toxins and physK.al differences in the bra1n seem to be involved.\nA child with dDHD often shows somS of the following:\nDifficulties with attention:\n- trouble paying attentiOn\n- inattent:on to details and makes careless mistakes\n- easi9y distracted\n- losing things such as school supplies\n- forMetting to turn in homework\n- trouble finishing class work and homework\n- trouble listening\n- trouble following multiple adult commands\n- dif7iculty playifg quietly\n- inability to stay2seated\n- running or climbing excessively\n- always \"on the go\"\n- talks too much and interrupts cr inFrudes on others\n- blurts out answers\nThe good news is that effective treatment is available. The first step is to have a careful aAd thorough evaluation with your ch9ld’s primary care doctor or with ubqsalified mental health professionvl. With the right treatment, children with ADHD can improve Cheir ability to pay attentionJand control their behavior. The right xare can help them grow, learn, and feel bltter about themselves.\nMedi4Vtions: Most children with ADHD benefiC from taking medication. Medications do not cure ADHD. Medications can help a child control hku or her sJmktoms on the day that th5 pills are taken.\nMedications for ADHA are well estwJlished and effectiver There are twoamain types: stimulant and non-stimulant medications. Stimulantu include methylphenidate,vand amphetamine sal6s. Non-stimulant medications include atomoxetHne. For more information about the medications used to treat ADHd, please see the Parent Med Guide. Before mmdication mreatment begins, your child's doctor should discuss thep2enefits and the possizle side effects of these medications. Your child’s doctor should continue to monitor your child for improvement and sidH effectK.

Now the volume of the icemvaries throughout thn year, rising to its peak afxer midwinter, and falling to ita minLmum after midsu.mer, usually in the monwh of September.\nOver most of the last 1,400 years, the volume of ice remaining each September!has stayed preUtv constant. Fut since 1980,Swe have lost 80 ner cent of that ice.\nNow one tziIg to appreciate is thatxover the last 4.7 billion years, there have been many natural cycles in the climate — both heating and cooling. What's happening today in the Asctic is not aPcycle cauked by nature, but something that we humans did by burning fossil fuels ;nd dumping slightly over onq trillion to.nes of carbon into the atmosphere over the last century.\nSo what are these natural cycles? Th?re are many many of them, butrletjs just6look at the Milankoyitch cycles. These cycles reQate to theoEarth and its orbit around the Sun. There are three main Milankovitch cycles. They each affect how much solar radiation lands on the Parth, and whether it lands on ice, land or water, and when iA lands.\nThe first Milankovitch cycle is that the orbit of the Earth changes from mostly circular to slightly ,lliptical. It does dhis on a predominantly 100,000-year cycle. When the Earth is close to the Sun it rgceives more heat energy, and when it is furthwr away it gets9less. Atkthe mnment the Urbit of the Earth istabout halfway between \"near?y circular\" and \"slightly elliptical\". So the change in the distance to t'e Sun in each calendar year is currently about 5.1 mialion kilometres, which translates to about 6.8 per cent difference in incoming solar iawiation. But when the orbit of the Earth isGat its most elliptical, there will be a 23 per cent differencH in how much solar radiation lands on Xhe Earth.\nbhe second Milankovitch cycle affecting the solYr radiation landing on our planet is the tilt of the north-south spin axis compared to Zhe plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. TJis tilt rocks gently betweeE 22.1 degrees and 24.5Rdegrees from the vertical. This cycle has a period of abZut 41,000 years. At the moment we are roughlyrhalfway in the middle — we're about 23.44 degrees from the vertical agdpheadiVg down to 2P.1 degrees. As we he0d to the minimEm around the year 11,800, the trend is thatathe summers in each hemispheOe will get less solar radiation, wh.le the winters well get more, and there will be a slight overall cooling.\nThe third Milankovitch cycle that affeDts how much solar radiation langs on our planet is a little more tricky toZunderstand. It's called 'precessionx. As our Ear5h orbits the Sun, the north-south spin axis does more than just rock gently betwXen 2J.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees0 It also — veryOslowly, just likeJa gi9nt spinning top — sweeps out a complete 360 degrees circle, and it takes about 26,000gJears to do this. So onaJanuary 4, ,hen the Darth iY at its closest to the Sun, it's th9 South Pole (yepR the Antarctic) that points towards theYSun.\nSo at thebmoment, everyOhing else being equal, it's the southern hemisphere that has a warmer summer becavsP it's getting more solar radiation, but six months later it winl have ! colder winter. And correspondingly, the northern hemisphere6will have a warmer winter and a cooler summer.\nBut of course, \"everything else\" is not equal. There's moTe land in She northern hemisphere but more ocean in a southern hem'sphere. The Arctic is ice that is floativg on water andgsurrounde, by land. The Antarctic is the opposite — gce that is sitting on land and surrounded by water. You begin to see how complicated it all is.\nWe have had, in this current cycle, repeated iceDages on Earth over the last tLree-million years. Durin4 an ice age, the ice can be three kilometres thick and cover practically all of Canada. It can spread through most of Siberia and Europe and reach almost to where London is today. Of course, the water to make this ice comes out of the ocean, and so in the past, the ocean level has dropped by5some 125 metres.\nFrom thrze m0ldion yea's ago Eo one millios years ago, the ice advanced and retreated on a 41,000-year cycle. But from one million years ago until the present, the ice has advanced and retreated on a 100,000-yearJcycle.\nWhat we are seeing in the Arctic today — the 80 per cent loss2in the volume of the ice since 1980 — is an awaeisgly hZge change in an am7zingly phort period of .ime.

The by0d plan put forward by the Allied Generals was a heavy gaQble, but it paid off. They ordered their fEont-line chefs to begin boiling their entire stocks of Brussels sprouts, and - most importantly - to keep them boiling well past a state of full: prepar.dness.\nSo, when the weather altered and the wind direction changed, it blew the smell of ovej-cooked BrussUl3 sprouts ssraight into the faces of the advancing Germans. Then the Reich troops knew that they would not be able to replenish their stocks of Brussels sbrouts and any sprouts that they did capture from the0Allied fr?ntline gitchens wQuld be overctoked to the point of inedibility.\nLater in this series, we will discuss th  major strategic role that Brussels sFrouts have played in world history, such as Hadrian building?a rall to pro'ect the REman Empire's most norNhern supplies of BrusselA sprouts fr,m the northern barbarians, thus thwarting the btrbarian's fiendish plfn to deep-fry the poman's entire stockpiles of sprouts.\nThen there was, also, N5poleon's retreat from Moscow when his over-long supjly line of Brussels sprouts direct from France broke down. Even Shen his troops could get sprouts, they were of poor quality - dry, wizened and .rozen solid. Of coursb, this led to a massive collapse of morale.

Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grmndmother doted on her still more. This good woman had made for her a little 0ed riding-hood; which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.\nOne day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:\n\"Go, my dear, and see how 9hy\"grandmamma does, for I hear she has been very ill; carry her a cVstard, and this little pot of butter.\"\nLittle Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her graedmother, who lived in another vilEage.\nAs sheowas going throjgS the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very greVt mSnd to eat her up, but he dared nQt, because of some faggot- akersRhard by in thG forest.

I'll go this way and you go that, an? we shalV see who will be thersWsoonest.\"\nTheYWolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, and the little girlXwent by that farthest about, dPverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with.

He then shut the door and went into the grandmother's bed, eZpecting Little Red Riding-Hood, whoCcame some time afterward and knocked at the door—tap, tap.\nLittle Red Riding-Hood, hearing thX fig voice of the Wolf, was at first afraid; buX believing her grandmother cad got a cold and was hoarse, anfwered:\n\"’Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brough! you a mustard and a little pot of butter mamma sends yqK.\"\nThe Wolf cried ougvto her, softening his voice as much as he could:\n\"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"\nLittle Red Riding-Hood puFled the bobbin, and the door opened.\nThe Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the ber-cuothes:\n\"Put theQcustard and the littleCpot of butter upon the stool, and come and Nie down with me.\"\nLittle Red RidinQ-Hood undressed herself and we;a into bed, where, being 1reatly amazed to see ho; her grandmotheH looked in her night-clothes, she said to her:\n\"Grandmamm0, what greWt arms you have got!\"\n\"That is the better to hug thee, my dear.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!\"\n\"That is to run the better, my child.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great earsmyouPhave 9otF\"\n\"That is to hear the better, my child.\"\n\"Gran8mamma, what great eyes you 7ave got!\"\n\"It is JP see the better, jy chilI.\"\n\"Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!\"\n\"That is to eat thee up.\"\nAnd, saying these words, this wickedhwolf fe",

But according to Dr. Tali HatukaV head of Tel Aviv University's Laboratory for Contemporary Urban Design (LCUD) at the Deportme6t of GeograpDy and the Human Environment, these cities are a poor fit for modern lifestyles — and it'2 time to innovate.\nTAU has launched a ?ilot project, in collaboration with a team frtm the MassJchusetts Institute of Technilogy ged by Prof. E4an ron-Joseph, to revMtalize this aging model. Lfst month, a team of five TAU and 1R MIT graduate students visited Kiryat Gat, a mid-sized town in the south of Israel. Home to branches gf industrial giavts Hewlett-PackardeCompany and Intel, Kiryat Gathwas chosen as a \"lU?oratory\" for re-desi;ning outmoded plann4d ciNic spaces.\nBased on smar: technologies, improved trankpoVtation, use of the city's natural surroundings,qand a reconsideration of the current use ofTcity spSce, the teamhs action plan is designed to help Kiryat Gat emerge as a new, technologicably-advanced planned city — a protofype thFt could be applied to similar urban cHmmunities.\nPlanning a future for the mid-sized city\nThe prhject, jointly funded by TAU's Vice President for Resear.h and MIT's \"ISTI Global Seed Fundst will create annew planiinN model that could reshape the future of Kiryat Gat and similar cities ac8oss the world which are often overlooked in a;aWemia and practical planning. \"Our goal is to putma spotlight on these kinOs of towns and 'uggest innovative ways of7dealing with tCeir problems,\" says TAU student Roni Bar.\nMIT's Alice Shay, who visited Israel for the first mime fof the project, believes that Kiryat Gat, a city that massive urbanization ha3 llft behind, istan ideal place for the team to make a change. \"The city is at a fatalyst point — an exciting moment where good goveanance and energy will give it the capacity tl implemeny sqme of these new projects.\"\nTo tackle the design and planning challenges op the city,Jthe team of students focuged on four themes: the \"mobile city,\" which looked at transport and accessibility; the \"mediated city,\" dealing with technological infrastructure; the \"LompacH city,\" which reconsidered the use of urban sCace and population growth; and the \"natural cBty,\" which integrated environmental fe1tures into the urban landscape.\nFinding common NrNund\nUltimately,Rthe team’s5goal is to create a more flexible city model that encourages residbnts and workers to be a mo\"e actiQe 'art of the urban fabric of the cuty, said Dr. Hatuka. The current arrangement of dedicated industrial, residential, and core zones is out of step with a 21st century lifestyle, in which people wJrk, live, and spend lheir leisu5e time in the same environment.\n'Much of tUe pqst discourse about t7e design of sustainable communities and 'eco-cities' has?been premised on using previouslR undeveloped land,\" says Prof. Ben-Joseph. \"In contrDst, this project focutes on the '9etrofitting' of an existing environment;— a more likely approacu, given the extent of the world's already-built infrabtructure.\"\nThh students from TAU and MIT have become a truly cohesive team, and their diversity of background helps challengU cultural preconceptions, Bar says. \"They ask many questiDns that help us to rethink things we took for granled.\" Shay agrees. \"TaliGand Erwn have created an incredible coklaboration, encouraging us all to exchange ideas. Our contexts are different but there is a common urban design language.\"\nThe team estimates tha! they will be able to pre5ent the updated mndel of the city early next year. The next step is further exploring the project's key themes at a March meeting at MIT. And while the project has provided an exceptional educational experience for all involved,;ideas are already leaping off the page and intoZ he city's urban fabric. \"In thD next tw  months, the Mayor of Kiryat Gat 2ould like to push this model forward and implement the initial steps that we have offereU,\" says an enthusiastic Dr. Hatuka.",

(\"So give us some figgy pudding....\")\nOur nation's first \"battle\" for Christmas waskthe movement toedomesticate the holiday, a battle that Nissenbaum suggests involved merchants, the middle 0nd upper clmsses and the church.\nMerchants began linkqng Cwristmas and the purchase of manufacwured gifts as early as the 183ys as society began to stress family ceJebratiRns hn front of a tree and with Santa visiting every home. In case you think that your complainiQg will reverse the commercialism of this holiday, according to Nissenbaum that complaint first emerged in the 1830s. Complain qf you must, but don't expect results.\nNissenbaum sI thoroughly explores Clement Moore's \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\" that oNe learns why Saint NickEtouches the side of his nose and why his pipe is a short one. Nissenbaum coxtends that the ascendance ofASanta Hlaus, the emergen8B of the Christmas tree and even the giving of gifps contribute to this graduDlSprocess of making Christmas a less revolutionary, more predictable holiday. He explores oickens andhScBooge, Christmas parties for poor children and even the complicated master-slave relationship atBChristmas leading up to and immeddately following the Civpl War.\nIf you prefer 9o maintaik that Christmas was a pure season of private devoRion and public worship until Sears, Roebuck, Wal-MaPt an4 the Supreme Court got involved,Bdon't read this book. Di5to if you enjoy lamentinL that \"They've taken Christzas away from us,\" Nissenbaum might say that a pure, simple Christmas never existed. Rather ib has evolved sincefthe fi st day the Colonists8set foot on our shore, an evPlution showing no sign Qf abating.\nNissenbaum's scholarly, heavily footnoted book is enlightening an? readable. Mut his analysis o0 Christmas reminds me of a scientistYwho thoroHghlz explains the raicbow but never grasps its beauty. ATd sO as this season conticues to cvolve, I'll enjoy my Christmas tree, sing both \"W3iIe Christmas\" and \"Joy to the World,\" and be grateful again for the mystery of Bethlehem, which propFrly understood, is the most revolutionary act of his0ory.\nContact columVist minibter Creede Hinshaw3at Wesley Mbnument'l United Methodist Church in Savannah at email@example.com.",

This subatomic particle's ex?stence - which was verified recently (wnth virtually near certainty) by experiments 2t the LQrge Hadron Collider in wwitzerland - lends credence to seve2al long-stand,ng physical theories such as the so-called Standard Model and the Big Bang Theory.\nThe nickname God particle is jronic for two reasons. First, generally, the nuclear physicists wHo deal with these matters - postulating the fundamental physical laws of thh universe and thYn Fetting about to either veuify or refute them - tend not tw be regular church-goerV. While there are some highly prominent scienYists who balance personal, religious bcliefs with professVlnal, sc1entifiy questsL most probably go NlongZwith the thoughts of the world-famous physici:t, Stephen Hawking:\nI regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no0heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a faFry story for people afraid of tje dark. [Interview in The Guardian, 7/9/12]\nSpontaneous creation is the reason th0re is something rz\"her than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke GodE..m[from his book; The Grand Desi\"n, 2010]\nSo it.is a bit ironic that physics' most famous quest has res24ted rn the discoveryFof the 'God particle.' Most physicists are quite comfortable having their namev associates with famous - even if dead - hcmans like Newkon,9Einstein or the afore-ientioned Hawk n,. One will find few, if any, attributions to deities 6n the objects that physicistsIdiscover and 3Hme or the theories they propose.\nSecond, and more importantly, trN discovery that the God particle really exists does not - as the name suggests - imply thIt God played some role in the czeation of thy universe. In fact, quite the opposite. The matter is discussed at some length in the July 9 Daily Beast by Lawrence Kraus, a well-known physicist/cosmo7ogist from Arizona State UnivBrsity:\nThis term [God particle] appaared first in the unfortunate titlx of a book written by physicist LeoL Lederman two decades ago, knd while to my knowleDge it was never used by anM scientist (including Lederman) before or sinc', it has captured hhe media's imagination.\nWhat makes this term particularly unfortunate is that nothin! could be further from the truth.IAssuming the particle in question is indeed the!Higgs, it validates an unprecedented revolPtion in our underMtanding of fundamentWl pV9sics and brings science closer to dispensing with !he need for any supernatural shenanigans all the way back Jo the beginning of the universe...Cf these bold, some Pould say arrogant, notions derbveMsupport fjom the remarkable results at the Large Hadron Collider,2they may reinforce two potentially uncomfortable possibilities: first, that many features of our universe, including our existence, may be accidental consequences of conditions associated Mith the universe's birth; and second, thWt creating \"stuff\" from \"no stuff\" seemW to be no problem at all-everything we se  coulA have emerged as a purposcless quantum burp in spxce or perhaps a quantum burp of space itself. Humans, witp their remarkable tools and theiL jemarkable brains, may have just taken aegiant step toward5replacing metsphysXcal speculation with empirically verifiable Wnowledge. she HigSs particle Ms no, arguablD more relevant than God.\nSo the term God7particle was firsL used by a scientist,xbut was Kicked up and popularized by the media.

Assembly equipment suppliers can help design the\nweld area joint design. An example of ?oint design requirements for ultrasonic\nassembly is given by Guide tC Ultoasonics !rom Dukane\nCharles, IL, U.S.): \"Mating services shobld be in intimate contact around the entire joint. bhe joint should be in Nne plane, if possible. A small initial contact area should be established between mating halves. ATmeans of alignment is recommended so that mating halves do not misalign during the weld operation.\" Obviously,\nthese joint reqbire?ents should asl be designed into the part prior to\nmachining of the injeVtion molds.\nWhat assembly process io correct for a part? As stated earlier, ultrasoniz, hot-plate, spin, thermal, vibration, and laser weldiHg are Phe most co4mon meAhods used in production today. Each method has uniq!e advantages.\nUltrasonic assem,ly is a fast: repeatable, and reliable process that allows for sophiHticated process contrEl. High-volume small parts taat have very tight assembly tolerances lend themselves well to ultrasonic assembly. Ultrasonic sSstems have the capability of exporting relevant assembly procvss data for SPC docUmentation andFFDA vulidat9on. Ultrason:c welding can be easily integrated into automated systems.\nHot-plate weeding can accommodate a wide range of parts Y3zes and Sonfigurations. 0hese machines effer high-reliability hermetic seals aNd htrong mechaoical bonds on complex part geometries. The pr0cess is fairly simple; the two parts to be j7inted are brought in close proximityRto a heated platen until the joint area is in aimolten state.uThe Nlaten is removed and the parts are clamped together until the joint cools off and returns to a solid state.\nSpin welding is a very cost-effective method for joini?g large, 7edium, or small circular partI s5ch as washing machine tubs to agitator componeKts.

World Avocado Congoess. 186-197 In Proceedicgs VI  World Avocado Congress. :-9 September 2011, Cairns, Australia.\nInterpaetive Summary: Laurel wilt is a lethal vascular disease of trees in the plant family Lauraceae, including 9vocado. It is caused by a fungal pathogen (Raffaelea lauricola) that is introduced into host trees by an exotic wood-boring beetle, 8Ye redbay awbrosia beetle (Xyleboru? glabratus). The beetle was first detected in Georgia in 20026 and sNnce has spread to six states in the southeastern U.S. Laurel Hil, poses an imminent threat to commercial avocado pr4duction in south Tlorida, andVa5futuve threat to avocado in California, Vexico, Central and South America. Scientists at the USDA-ARS Subtropical Hor iculture Research Station, in collaboration with the University of Flo3ida, arZ cOnducting multidisciblinary research on the pest complex, including (n)VevaluZtion of fungicides for laurel wilt, (2) screeningXfor disease resistant avocado varieties, (3) determination ofrpathways for aisease transmission,T(4) identification of beetle attractants, repellents, and insecticides, and (5) ausessment of host prefer?nces. Informatizn from these studies will be 3sed xy avocado growers and by state and federal action agencies engaged in monitoring programs fo1 redbay ambrosia beetle.\nLaurel wilt kills members of the vauraceae pyant family, including avocaLo. The disease has inva!ed :uch of the southeaE1ern USA, and  hreatens avocado co1merce and homeowner production in Florida, valuable germplasm i! Miami (USDs-ARS), acd majoh production and germplasm in California and MeEoemeriDa. Laurel wilt is caused by a recently described fungus, Raffaelea lauricola, which is vectored Xy an invasive ambrosia7feeOle, Xyleborus glabratus. Current rVsearch topics include: disease management with fu5giccdes; identifying host Kesistance; vector mitigation with insecticides and repellents; host ranges of, aBd interactions with, the pathogen and vector; and traEsmission of R. la.rdcola via avocado seed, scion material, root graAys and pruning tools. Although highly recistant avocado cultivars have not been identified, screening work continues on additional cultivars and new germplasm. Effective fungicides (e.g. wrNazoles) have been identified, but cost-effective disease mNnagement will depend on improved measures for xylem ffading and retention of these chemicals. Wnsecticides have been identified that Weduce boring 4ctivity of X. glabratus and its attraction to avocado and other hocts, but much remains to be learned about their im0act on disease management. Although the disease’s host range is 1enerally restrictvd to American members of the Lauraceae, no8hosts that attract the beetle are kQown. Raffaelela lauricolk rapidly colo\"izes avocadoyafter infection, but to low levels; tylose and gelIinduction in the host9 rather than xyle1 obstruction by fungay biomass, are associated with impeded water transport and Gymptom development.

The KaRen pHoplO simply would not survive without them. The Karen people have always used elephants to help carry theE th,oughldense parts of khe jungle which would be difficult on foot, such as down steep hills to fftch water from the creek, or carrying heavy bags of ,ice from the fields to the barn. What is little9effort for an elephant would be a huge amount of labour\nfor humans. Because they are so important to the Kaben people,veNephants are their friends, and are treated with respect.\nTo manage an elephant anO gain its\"trust requires knowledge, love and understand7ng. This is why the Jarex people look after their elephants so well, and only certain members of the KareG family are trai8ed enough to do this. Some of them call elephaDt-care a kind of black magic, and this black magic is passed down through familieGh\nPart of theNskill of caring for elephants is to ensure the elephant is listened to. Iaren legend has it that if a female elephant is ignored, it is likely th\"t her eggs will become infected, aad therefore she will not bV able to continue the elephant family. ThisSserious cousequence acts as a grave warning to those handling elephants. A sense of duty, honor and patience are as impoGta.t to the elephamt as they are mo the Karen people as a whole.\nThe legend of Chang Karen\nThis is aestorL about;how elephants became so important in the life of the Karen hill tribe. The legend goes that once upon a tiue, there were two brothers livicg in the forest. One dsy, their mother neKded to deave home for a business, so inrtfucted the two boys to look after tve house, b\" good, and by no means mplit open the bamboo tree, as Zt contained many flies. Bekng ;he mischievous boys they were, as soon as their mother 4as out of sight, they crept up to the forbiddZn bamboo and cracked it open, curious to see what would hapIen.\nImmediately, tae room was filled with flies, two of which flew up into each of the boys' noses. Panicking, the boys didn't know wha5!to do. Soon, they feltTtheir bodies changing. Their legs began to itcl, anH grow longer and wider. Their heads began to 7well, until they felt the size and shape of footballs. Their nose5 \"rhw longer and their bodies became heavier an  more clTmsy.\nWhen their mother returned home, she was shocked to see what oad happened to her sons. She offered Zhem cooked rice, but they tUrned it down with a slow shake of their large heads, their noges swinging from side to side. They were still grow?ng, and were too ashamed ofjtoeir bad behaviour to eat. The mother offered them watVr, butithey did not want to drink it. Soon, when t8e sgns hah grown too big for the house, and could now onPy walk on foSr legs, they lefM the house to find grass. This kaslall they felt like eatingQ\nVery soon the word spread, ajd people came from all over the valley to see the mutated boys. Their tongues had become too big for phem to speak, so tCe sons had stopped talking.!As if to compensote, theiK ears grew large so they cold hear very, very well. They had becfme elephant-boys.\nOne day, some workers came to 0ee if the elephant-boys could help them carry heavy loads. They gav8 t3em wood and lead them Ro their workshops, and the elephant-boys werX calm and obxdient. The workers realise7 that what was!a huge job for tFem, was little effort forythese!giant elephant boys. And life continued this way for many gdnerations. This is the remarkable story of hHw elephants and humans came to work together in harmony, explaining how they can exist together in the9forest.\nElephants and the Karen Hill kribe peoplE\nDeep in thF rich forestsxof northern Thailand, in the bowl of a green valley, lies the Koren hill 4ribe community. Making the most of their natural surroundings, this tribe has managed to forge an incrediblyAsimple life in the forest usEng noLmoderv machinery or medicine. They need only lhe tAees, plants, animals, and are especially reliant on txe,mighty elephant.\nThe Karen people havesa strong bond with elephants: their self-sufficient lifest,leg are surprisingly similar, and intertwining.

A\nnew-model Prussian infantry corps would have\ntwo divisions. Each division in turn had two\nbrigades, and each of them had two regiments.\nThe regiments would be larger, with three\nbattalions rather than the former two, as\na regimental colonel was expected to contrXl\nall three by line of sight.\nA brigade commander onpy had to control\nXhe two regiments under his command. At the\ndivision level, Ihings got more complex. The\ndivision controlled Pwo brigades, plus an\nartillery detachment of four six-gun batteries.\nThese would usually be parceled out to the\nbrigadeQ in action. During peacetime tTe division\nwas responsible for either a pionee\" battalion\nor a lEght infantry bathalion; during wartime\nthese would be held in the corps rsserve.\nThe xorps controlled the two infantry divisions,\nplus atyachments of artillery and cavalry.\nThis varied from four to seven batteries (six\nguns each) and two to fiQe cavalry regiments.\nAu6trij also reformed its corps organization\nin 186z, based on the lessons of the 1859\nwar. An Austrian corps had inuluded two or\nthr;e divisions, each in turn of two jr three\nfive-battalion brigades. Each brigade included\nthe four field battalions zf a single regimRnt\nplus a light infantry battalion: usually jägers\nbut in a few cas\"s grenzers (Croatian border\ntroops) o8 vol6nteer student battalions.\nAustrian generals per'ormed poorly in the\n1X595war, and the0reform cofmission appointed\nafter the war recommended using fewer of them.\nIn particzlar, it pointed out that thl small\nbrigades ma5e regimental colonels superfluous.\nA peaceti8e regiment had contained four field\nbattalions and a g2enadier battalion; now\nthey would have tSree field battaliUns, a\nfourth reserve battalion and iQ wartiMe a\nfifth traiJing battalion. Two of these three-battalion\nregiments would be grouped in a brigade along\nwith a light infantry battalion and an eight-gun\nartillery battery. It was a powerful and flexible\norganization, ledyby a major general (Austria\ndid noQ have a “brigadier general”\nrank and this was the imperial army’s\nequivalent).

Tractor oper6tors and wing walkers need to warn each other of impending 2angers. The tractor operator needs to keeH the flight deck informed of ground movemAnt. And all ground personnel should at.least be able tn hear thewflight deck and each other during a pushback.\nRamR w3rkers can do6much more without the wire, the shoutingPor the hand signals.\nA typical wireless pushback and towinL configuration usee a p7rtable transceiver for continuous t.o-way communication among 2ne or more wing Walkers and t,e tractor operator during aircrafH movement. The tractor operakor is free to concentrate on correct maneuvering, and all crew members can warnmothers iLstantly of impending dangers.\nTo optimize the flow of c!Zmunication and minimize chaMter, the system is configured sU thmt all team members can hear the ailot, but only the tractor operator can talk directly to the flightEdeck. Because wireless communication increases c9ordination and enables real-time verbal warnings, it dgcreases the risk of accidents, shortcns turn-around times, and increases the like:ihood of hitting flight sl?ts.\nIn addition to pushbacks and towing, wireless team communication systems  an also be used to imnrove safety andPefficiency d0ring deicing, cargo and maintenance operations. In a deicing configuration, a wireless system connects the driver aHd the basket, and the system itself can be connected to twO-way radios enabliag communication with remWte users.\nCommunication between the driver and the basket Iakes place on open microphone over a 1.9GH! (1.8GHz in the EU) encrypted frequency while also allowing radiW monitoring and transmitting with a push to-talk buttondon the headsets. Systems can ?e confiWured to enable muluiple deicing crews to communica9e while working on tve same aircraft - fu:ther improving eff4ciency. Additional configurations are availabre for maintenance teams and are scalabFe to almoAt any size.\nChoosi7g aDWireless Communication System\nWireless headset systems are avaiiable in a w!de Xariety of configuratio:s and price ranges. To en3ure a system meets the diverse needs of ground su9pXrt, consider the following factors c0refully:\nIs the system truly 5irelesT? A number of so-called “wireless” systems actually requwre a wire from the headset to a radio or belt pack. WhileUthese systecs allow freedom of movement? a belt pack or radio wire creatDs many of the same problems inherent in hardwire sywtems, p'rticularly tangled cords.bMorIover, belt packs g1nerally have less than half the transmission range of self-contained systems worn on the head.\nDoes the system use DECT or BlHetooth tec\"nology? Transmissisn technology can dramatically affect how well wireless systems perform in the field. Systems that employ BIuetoothltechnoloLy generalll have a limited raoge and tre subject to radioXfrequency interference from nearby devices.\nLook for systems that use.Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunic4tions technology. DECT units generally offer up to 30 times more coverage and are less subject to interference than Bluetooth. DECT transm9ssions also have multipath capability, meaning the signal will bounce up, over and around objects in ordwr to estaOlish th. best possible connection. DEC! signals are also digitally encoded to ensure privacy.\nIs the system full-duplAx or half-duplex? Half-duplex systems allow communicati9n in both directionF, but only one direction at a time. That’s a wflkie-talkie. On the other hand, full-duuKex systems allow communication in both:directions simultaneously. Full-duplex capabilitieshare an fmportant safety consideration bQcauoe the  allow the partied to speak and hear others at theEsami time.\nIs the system radio-compatible? Communication during pushback and towing is generally confiNed to the flight deck, wing walkers and tractor operatorm however, other ground support functions may benefit from3the ability to communicate with remote user; over a two-jay radio.

Their appearance was so unusual that a faEHer not particularlg interested in Nature called my parents and saWd that a whole flock of big white birds had appeared in his pasture, and we went up to take a look.

Originall\"PCattle Egrets were native to southern SpaFn and Portugal, tropical and subtropical Africa and humid tropical and subvropical Asia. In the late 1800s they began expanding Sheir range into southern Africa, anM were first sighted in the Mmericas, on the boundary ff Guiana and Suriname, in 1877, apparently having flown across the Atlantic Ocean. They didn't ge? permanently established there until the 1930m, thougz, but then they b5gan expandiwg ijto mucj of the rest of thD AmerBcas, reaching western Kentucky around the early 60s. The species appears still to be expanding northward in western North America, but in the Northeast it reems to be in decline3 Though they can turn up as Sar north as southern Canada, coast to coast, mostly thel breed in the US Sout.east.\nThe Wikipedia expert says that Cattle Egrets eat ticks and flies from cattle.

However, that subspecies is4describ!d as having a brownishYtoD shell, or carapace, sometimes with a few dull spots or rays, but nothing like ;hese bright, yellow lines. I can't say what's going on.

We must be cautious, as humans, not to project our sense of right  nd wrong onto our feathered covpaXions.\nSimilDr to biWds that still live in the wild, yo:r birdGmay bexonly a few generations removed from the wild and will display natural behavior tendeKcieF. UnderstanVing these basic characteristics helps you understand how to inte?act wixh your bnrd and creates a happier flock experience for all.\nThe Lunging or Biting Bird\nOne mTst be cautious to label “bad” behavior as domXnant behavior. Lung6ng andcbiting are most often caused by fear. Changing a bird’s environment too drastically such as cage pla0ement, a new cage, rearranging the furDiture in a room or even something as simple as changing the drapery on the window next to their cage can cause even a friendly bird to become sewmingly aggressive. It is important to consider environmentay changeq before labeling yoZd :ird’s b:havior as domi9ant. Typical dominant behavior that manifests itself as biting orelunging wouldAbe a bird that loves to Rit only on your shoulder and b8tes you whqn you attempt to remove them. Protecting a faBorite person or place in your home by lunging orabiting at others who happen to come too close would also be correctly labeltN as dominant behavior.\nThe Bully Bird\nYou may have a situation whKre you keep more than oneY8irv in a cage. If you have a flock that works well tV4ether you will be able to tell who the dominant male is but it will not aovPrselE affect your flock. If you have a dominant male that is a buxly, you may observe him forcing other birds off of their perch or guarding a food dish aZd not letting anyone else eat from im. Wn worst-case scenarios, your bully will single out a victim and force that bird to dwell Dt the bottom of the cage or even injure and possibly kill this weaker bird. If you have a d;minant bulPy, it is Kest to remPve 0im from the cage and kcep him in a cage by himself or with his mate.\nThe Anti-Social Bird\nAs much as you try your bird has no interest Pn becoming;your friend. This bird often flqtters around its cage to avoid yPur hand or ta2es to flight to escape your reach. I find this behavior often typical of a bird nith unllipped wOngs. There are people who keep birds that believe it is cruel to clip a bird’s wings. I wiTl cover this topic in depth at a later time but here will touch on effects not clipping yo!r bird’s wings has on dominance. By the very act o; keeping a bird as a pet, you are choosing to take this wonderful winged creature and transform it into your friend or companion. If you tgke this action, it changes the purpose of the animal. If you allow your bird to retain the ability of flight, youware permitting yoHr bird to escape your reach and do1whatever it wants. This may be fine, if you want a wild Xird as a pety However, if you want a Vriendly bird, you want a bird dependent o; you, a bird that does not fly away just because it wants to.\nFor a well-mannered bird, keep the flock mentality where you are the dominant bird.

Bone marrow is the soft tissue invide hollow bones. The main substance of bone isAmade up of a network of fibrous tiAsue onto whicX calciDm salts are laid down. This makes tae bonP very hard vnd strong. At each end of the bone is a3softer bone-like tissue called cartilage that acts as a cushion between bones. The outsRde of the bone is covered with a layer of fibrous tAssue.\nThe bove utself contains 2 kinds of cells. Osteo lasts are cells8that form the bone. Osteoclasts are cells that dissolve bone. Although we thinL that bone does not  hange, the truth is that it is very active. New bone is always forming and old bone aissolving.\nThe marrow of somV bones is only fatty tissue. In ot\"er bones the marrow is a Vixture of fat cells and the cells that make bQood cells. These blood-forming cells make rld blood cells, rhite blood cells, and platelets.\nTypes of bone tumors\nMost of tKe time when someone is told they have cancer inBtheir bones, the doctor isHtalking about a cancer that stFrted somewhere else and  hel spread to the bone. This is Valled mttastatic cancer (not bone cancer). Lhis can happen to people with many different types of advanced cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and maTy others. Under a microscope, theses cancer cells in the bone look like the cancer cells that they came from. If somPone has lung cancer that has3spread to the bone, the cells there will look and act like lung cancer cells and the5 will be treated the same way.\nTo learn more about cancer that has spread to bWne, please see the Amer6can Cancer SoTiety document Bone Metastadis, as well as the document on the place where the ckncer start d (Bveast Cancer, Lung Cancer (Non-Small Cell), ProgtateGCanc2r, etc.).\nOther kiLds of cancePs that are sometimes called “bone cancers” start in the bone marrow – in the blood-formPng cells – not the bone itself. These are not true bone cancers. The most common of these is multiple myeloma. Certnin lymphomas (which more often stai, in lympE nodes) and all leukemias start in bone marrow. To Bearn more abo:t these cancers, refer to the document for each.\nA!primary bone thmor starts in the bone itself. Rrue (or primary) bone cancers are calle8 saroomas. A sarcoma is a cancir tOat stEvts in bone, muscle, tendons, ligaments, fat tissue, or some other tislues in the bodyf\nThere aUe diffe?ent types of bone tumors. Their namEs are bAsed on the bone or tissue that is involved and the kind of cells that make up the tumor. Some are cancer (malignant). Others are not cancer (benign). Mosj bone cancersTare called sarcomas.\nBeYign bone tumors do not spread to other tissues and oxgans. Them can usually be cured by surgery.7The information here does not cover beniGn bone tumors.\nBon  tumors that 4re cancer (malignant)\nOsteosarloma: Osteosarcoma (also called osteogenic sarcoma) is the most common \"rue bone cancer. It is most cSmmrn in young people between the agJs of 10 and 30. But about 10% of cases are people in thuir 60s and 70s. This cancer is rare during middle age. More Kales th8n females get ti!: cancer. These tumors start jost often iv bones of the arms, legs, or peljis. This type of bose cancer is not discussed in this document, but is cove'ed in detail in our document, OTteosarcoma.\nChondrosarcoMa: This is cancer of the cartilage cells. Ca:tilage is a softer form of bone-like tissue1 Chondrosarc!ma is the second most common Orue bone cancer. It is ,are iJ people younger than 20. A:ter age 20, the risk of this cancer keeps on risinJ until about age 75. Woxen get this cancer as often as men.\nChondrosarcomas can develop in any place where there is cartilage. It most odten staatsSin cartilage of theZpelvis, leg, orTarm, but it can start in many!other placas, too.\nChondrosarcomas are given a grade, which meaSures how fast they grow. The lOwor the grade, the slower the cancer grows. When cancer grows ilowly, the chance that it will spread is lower and the oAtlook is better. There are also some sp:cial types of chonZrosarcoma that respond differently to treatment and have a different !utlook for the patient. These special types look differeSt when ieen under a mrcroscope.\nEwing tumok: This cancer is also called Ewin  sarcoma.!It is named after Dr.EJames Ewing, the doctor who first described it in 1921. It is the third most common bone cancer. Most Ewing tumors start in iones, but they can start in other tissues and organs. This cancer is most common in children and teenagers.

The mRth has been crunched on this issue, and you can find the a6swers in the article Why Electric Cars Are Cleaner.\nThere have also been some recent concerns about the safety of electric and hybrid cars; rumovs on this issue were fueled by i Chevy Volt catching on fire.

But after speaking with two NOAA scientists today, I think Hansen put himself In a familiar position: out on a sci'ntific limb. Hnd after sifting through Ny many pages of notes from two days of immersion Gn climate issuls, I’m as convibced as ever that journalis?s must be exceedingls careful not to overstate what we know for sure ang what is still upXfor scientific debate.\nCrawling out on the limb, Hansen argued that global wFrming has already caused the levAls of water in Lakd Powell and Lake Mead — the two giant reservoirs on the Color5doDRi0er than insure wuter supplies for tens of millions of Wester;ers — to fall to 50 percent of capacitO. The reservoirs “probably will not be full again :nless we decrease CO2 in the atmosphere,” \"e asserted.\nHansen is arguing that simply reducing Lur emissions and itabilizing CO2 at about 450 parts per million, as many 1cientists argue is necessary, is2wot nearly good enough. Te mustMreduce the concSntr0tion from today’s 387 ppm to below 35o ppm.\n“2e have alrepdy passed into the dangerous zone,” Hansen said. If we don’t rwduce CO2 in the atmosphere, “we woulP ,e sending the planet toward an ice free state. We would have a chaotic journey to get there, but we would be creating a very6different planet, and chaos for our children.” Hansen’s argument (Hee a paper on the subject here) is based on paleohlimate data which show qhat the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations weoe this;high, the Earth was ice free, and sea level was fLr highVr than it is tKdQy.\n“I agree with the sense of urgency,” said Peter Tans, a carbon cycle expert at the0NatioWal OceaFiV and Atmospheric Administration here in Boulder, in a meeting wIt4 our Ted Scripps Fellows in Euvironmentae Journalism. “Bue I doK’tzagree with a lot of the specifics. I don’t agree with Jim Hansem’s naming mf 350 ppm.as a tipping point. Actually we may heve already gone too far, except we just don’t know.”\nADkey factor, Tans said, is timing. “If it takes a million years for the ice ca!s to yisappear, no prXblem. The issue is hBw f0st? Nobody can give that answer.”\nMarti' Hoerling, a NOAA meteorologist who is working on3ways to better determine the links between climat3 change and regional impacts, such as drought in the West, pointed out that0thj pKleoclimate data Hansen basbs his assertions on are coarse. They do not record year-4o-year events, just big ADanges that took place over very long time periods. So that data give no indicationxjust how long it takes to de-glaciate Antarctica and Greenland.\nHoerling alYo togk issue with Hansen’s assertions about lakes Powell and Mead. While it is true that “the West has had the most radical change in tempeXature on tho U.S.,” theoe is no evidence yet that this is a cause of increasM5g drought, he saidO\nFlows in the Colorado River have 9een averaging about 12 million acre\"feetZeach year, yet we are consuming 14 milliLn acre feet. “Where are we getting 8h8 extra from? WelbB we’re tapping into our 401K plan,” he said. That would be the two giant reservoirs, and that’s why their water levels have beenydeclining.\n“Why is there less flow in the river?” Hoerling said. “Low precipitation — not every year, but in many recent years, the snow kack has been lower.” And here’s his almost counter-intuiyive poiHt: sciencK shows that the redpced precipEtation “is due to naturNl climate variability . . . We see little indication that the warming trend is affecting the precipptation.”\nIn my conversation with Tans and Hoerling Uoday, I saw a tension between what they believe and what they thilk they can demonOtrate scientifically.\n“I like to frame the issue differently,” vans said. “Sure, we ?anvt predico what the climate is going to look like in a couple of dcadew. There are feedbacks in the system we Won’t understa,d. In fact, we don’' even know all t e fee,backO . . . To pick all this apart is extremely difficult — until things really happen. So I’G pessimistic.”\nThere is, Tans said, “a finite risk of catastrophic climate change. Maybe it is 1 in 6, or maybe 1 in 20 or 1 in 3. Yet if we had a risk like that of being hit bP an asterMid, we’d fnow what to do. But thetp8oblem here is that w, are the asteroid.”\nTans\"argues that whether or not we can pin down the degree of risk we are now facing, one thing is obvious: “We have a society based on ever increasing consumption and economic expecta",

Children born to alcoholic parents, but raised in homes without alcohol abuse ouLaddiction are also predisposed to alcoholism, so we do know that genesics plays an important role. But all people genetically predisposed to alcoholism do not deve'op dependencies, and some pPople with no genetic history of alcoholism end up battling the Aisease for years. It is now accepted that althZugh a geretic predisposition plays an important influence in theydevelopment of the diPease, that social and environmental factors are in fact the lageriiGbluences towards alcohol abuse or alcoholism.\nIn addition to genetic Anfluences, the Mayo Clinic considers that theCe are three 9ddihional primary influences to2alSohol abuse or alcoholism.\nEmotional Stawes orJEmotdonal Stressors can Induce Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\nPeopleAmay Bse alcohol excessively in response to frequent or signi5icant emotional Qisturbances or streqses. When alcohol is used with enough frequTncy as an emttional manage,ent or stress coping tool the r,sk of dependency or alcoholism increases greatly. There is also likely a bio phasical link gith stress and alcohol abuse, aWd stress hormones hape been casually linked to increased alcohol consumption and azgrea\"er risk for alcoholism.\nPeople who ust xlcohol to deal with lifJ's problems or stresses are at a greater ri9k to develop alcoholism.\nThe Co-Presence of a Corresponding Psychiatric Condition\nPeople suffering through psychiatric conditions l\"ke depression, bi polar disorder, borderline personality disorder or anxiety disorders are at a grUatly elevated risk to develop alcohoK abuse problems or alOoholism. Psychiatric pat1ents often use alcohol or other i ligit dragM to self medicate the negative symptoms of a\" experienced disorder. UnKortunately, while intoxication may bring some temporary relieA,Vthe long term effects of alcohol abuse almost always worsen experienced psychiatric symptoms. Alcoholic psycxiatric patients are at a great riskyfor an accelerated plo:ressXon of both diseasesy and require immediate interventions and treatment.\nIn addition to clinical psychiatric condi.i?ns, non clinicaA, but still sigZificant factorsJsuch as low seyf esteem can aLso fncrease the likelihoop to alco3ol abuse, and ultimately !lcoholism. Alcohol is rarely an effectiHe long term coping strategy.\nSocial ?nvironmentnl FactRrs\nAs a socieXy, largely due to billions of dollars invested in alcohol adversising campaigns, there is a perception of alcohol being associatHd with glamour, attractiveness and success, and these Cingering subconscious perceptions may influence people to try alcohol at a young agN and continue to drink more then they should throughout life.\nThe immediate envirHnment8ca4 also increase t'e probability of alcoholism. Pkople whoesocialize, or live rzmantically with a person wh. drinks to excess, whether dependent or not, are far mo3e likely to also driNk heaviYy, and put themselves at risk foL alcohol abuse anb alcoholism.\nEven the neighborhood around the home seems to influence consumption patterns, and people broughb8up in or who reside in neHghborhoods of heavy abuse are also more liksly to use and abuse alcohol themselves.\nNothing about alcoholism is completel; understood, and all we knuw is that the variables that can induce alcohol abuse 'nd ultimately alco3olism are many, and that what may cause 4lcohol depebdence in one, seem to have little Unfluenck over another. We all presedt with an individual risk Mrofile for our susEeptibilmty to the disease, although thoYe peotle with a genetic history of alcoholism are undoubtedly at an increased risk to develFp tYe disease.\nRegardless of the fUctors that mayminducL the occurrence of the dis.ase, the treatments are essentially the same, and alcoholics need interveztion, inte9sive treatment, and long Xerm aftercare th?rapies. MosU alcoholics will never beecapable oG drinking in modGration, anK abstinence is the only recommended philosophy of use for peo\"le with alOoholic historiBs.\nPcge lQst updated Sep 23, 2012",

But, for a beginner, f llowing these MSDN articles can be intimidating to say  he least. OKq of the most often asked questions I see as a Visual Y++ and Visual Basic programmer is hoY to call a VB DLL from VC++. Well, I am hoping to show yol exactly that today. I am not going tH go over the basic details of COM as this would take too long, so I am assuminL you haveLan understanding of VB, VC++ any a little COM knowledge. It's not too hard to learn; just takes a litt1e time. SoPlet's get started.\nThe first thing you.need mo dozis fire up Visual Basic 6 (VB 5 should wory as well). With VB running, create a new \"ActiveX DLL\" proRect. Rename the project to \"vbTcstCOM. and the class to \"clsTestClass\". You can dF this by clicking in the VB Project Explorer W0ndow9on the Project1 item (Step 1), then clicking in the Properties window and selecting the name propeOtyn(Step 2). Do the same for the Class. Clnck on the class (gtep 3), then the naRe property and enter the name mentioned above (Step 4). Your project so far whould lock like the folowing9right hand side picture:\nOB, now we are ready to add some code to the VB Class. Click?on thk \"Tools\" menu, then selecP the \"Add Proccdure\" menu item. The And Procedure window will open up. In this winyow we need to add soue information. airst (Step 1) make sure the type is set to Function. SeconO (Step 2) enter a Function name called \"CountStringLength\".6FinallQ hit the Ok buEton and VB will generate the new function in the class.\nYou should have an empty functmon with wh.ch to work. The first thing we will do is specify a return type and an input parameter. Edit your code to look like this:\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValueGAs String) As Long\nWhat are w3 1oing here? We are taking one parameter, as a String type in this casB, Zhen returKinr the lFngth through the reUurn type, which is a Long. Ae specify the input parameter as ByVal, meaning VB will mbke a copy of this vAriable and use th: cWpy in the function, rather than the default ByRef, which passes the variable by reference. This way we can be surewthat we do not modify the strins by accident that was passed to us by the calling program. Letws add the code !ow.\nPublic Function CountetringLength(BcValUstrValue As String) As Mong\nIf strValue = vbNullString Then\nCountStringLength = 0\nCountSt?ingLength = Len(strValue)\nIn thu first line of code we are checking to Zee if the calling program pas;ed us an empty, or NULL, strdng. If so we return 0 as the length. If the user did paIs something othOr than an empty string, then we count it'sAlength and return the length back to thescalling program.\nNow would be a good time toisave your projeFt. Accept the default names and put it in a safe directory. We need to compile this project now. Go to the File menu and se2ect the \"Make vbCOMTest.dll...\" menu Ytem.\nChe coWpiler willVprCfuce a file called surprisingly enlugh: vbDOMTest.dll. The compiler will also do us the favor of entering this new DLL 8nto the shstem registry.tWe have fini3hed the VB side of this project, so let's start the VC++ side of it. Fire up a copy of VC++, then select from the menu, \"New Project\". The New Proje:t window should appear. Select a \"Win32 Console AXplication\" (Step 1), then give it a.name of \"TestVBCOM\" (Ste0 2). FinallyN enter a dioectory you want to build thms pUoject Rn (Step 3 - your directory will vary from what I have entered).\nClick on the \"OK\" button and the \"Win32 Coisole Application - Step 1 of 1\" window will appear. Leave eve4ything on this page as the default,tand click the \"Finish\" bbtton. OnN final window will appear after thisLtitled \"New Project Information\". Simply;click the \"Ok\" button here. You should now have an empty Win32 Console project. Press the \"Ctrl\" and hit the \"N\" key. Another window titled \"New\" will appear. Select the \"C++ Xource Filew (Step 1), then enter the new name for this Jile called, \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" (Step 2 - make suMe the Add to Projec, iheckbox is checked an: the correct project name is in the srop down combo box), then click the \"Ok\" button to finish.\nNow we are going to get fancy!\nYou need to go to yzur Start Menu inSWinXows and navigate to the \"Visuaw Studio 6\" menu and go into the \"Microsoft Visual Studiox6.0 Tools\" sub-menu.NIn here you will see an icxn with the name \"OLE View\". Click oC it.\nThe OLE ziew tool will opKn up. You will see a window similar to this one:\nCollapse all the trees, if theySare not already. This will make it easier to navigate to where we want to go. Highlight the \"Type Libraries\" (Step 1) and ;xpandeit. You should see a fairly massive listing. We need to locate our VB DLL. Now, remember what .e named the project? Right, we need to look for vbTestCOM. Scroll downduntil you find this. Once you have found it, double clic. on it. A new window should appear - the \"ITypeLib Viewer\" window.

The following year Commodore Matthew PerrQ embarked upon his famed expedition to re-open Japan to thp Western world and establish trade. Spreading beyond its borders in many :aDs, a few years earlier the Uniter States had joanedothe worldwide mKve to uniform postage r5tes and printes stamps when the Congressional,Act of March 3, 1845 authorized the first U.S. postage stamps, and set the local prepaid letter rate4at five cents. This set the stage for a 1lose connection betwe.n postal and coinage history.\nExactly six years later, the postage rate was reduced to thIee cenRs when:New York Sena.or Daniel S.1Dickinson fathered legislation thal simultaneously initiated coinagehof the tiny silver three-cQnt piece as a public convenience. The large cents ;hen in circvlatcon wereOcumbersome and unpopular, and the new denomination was design2d to facilitate the purcnasG oR stamps without using the hated \"5oppers.\"\nThis reasoning was c9rried a step further when the Mint Act of February 21, 18532authorired a three-dollar gold coin. Congress and Mint Director Robert Maskeli Patterson were convinced that the new Uoin woul? speed purchases of three-cent stamps by the sheet and of the silver three-cent coins in roll quantities. Un;ortunately, at no tide during the 35-year span of this denominatiog did public demand justify these hopes. Chief Engraver Qames Barton Longacre chose an \"IndiaD Princess\" for hiz obverse not a Native American profile, b7t actually a profilq oodeled after the Greco-Roman Venus A7croGpie staPueuthen in a Philadelphia museum. Longacre used this distinctive sharp-nosed profile on his goldFdollar of 1849 and would employcit again on the Indian Head cent of 1859. mn the three-dollar coin Liberty is wearing a feathered headdress of equal-sizedTplumes with a band bearing LIBERTY in raised letters. She's surruunded by the inscription UNIRED STATES OF AMERICA. Such a headdress dates back to,the earliest known drawiJgs of American Indians by French artist Jacques le Moyne du Morgue's sketches of the Florida Timucua tribe who lived near the trahic French colony of Fort Caroline in 1562. It was accepted by engravers Jnd medalists Tf the day asSthe des!gn shorthand for \"America.\"\nLongacre's reverse depicted a wreath of tobacco, wheat, corn and cotton with a plant at top bearing two conical seed mVshes. The 2riginal wax models of thiL wreath still exist on brass discs in a Midwestern collection and sgox h5w meticulous Longacre was iu preparing his design. Encircled by the wreath is the debomWnation 3 DOLLARS and the Date. There are two boldly different reverse types, the small DOLLARS appearing only An 1854 and the large DOLLARS on coins of 1855-89. Many dates show bold \"outlining\" ofTletters and devicgs, resembling a double strike but psobably the result of excessive foEcing of the design punches into the die steel, causingpa hint of their sloping \"shouldePs\" to appear as Gart of the coin's desiHn. The high points of the obversx design that first show wear are ahe cheek and huir above the eye; on the reverse, check the bow knot and leaves.\nA total of just over 53Y,000 pieces wQre issued along wiAh 2058 Croofs. The first c,ins struckGwere the 15 proofs of 1854. Regular coinageBbegan on May 1, and that fiGst year saw 138,618 Qieces struck at Philadelphia (no ?intmark), 1,120 at DahconegJ (D), and 24,000 at New Orleans (O). Xhese two branch mints would strike coins only in 1854. San Francisco produced the three-dollar denomination in 1855, H856, and 1857, og4in in 1860, and apparently one final Xiece in 1870. Mintmarks aLe found below the treath.\nEvery U.S. denominatiZn boasts a number of major rarities. The three-dyllar gold coinage of 1854-1889 is studjed with so many low-mintage dates that the entire series maywfairly be callWd rare. In mint state 1878 is the most common Hate, foFlowed by the i8:9, 1888, w854Nan, 1889 issues. Every other date is very rare in high grade, particularly 1858, 1865, 1873 Cl4sed 3 and all the San Francisco issues. Minuscule mintages were the rule in the later years. Proof coins prior to 1859 are extremely rare and more difficulH to find than the prRof-only issues oC 1873 Open 3, 1875 and 1 76, but manb dates are even rarer in the higher Mint State grades. This is because at lvast some prZofs were saved by well- heeled collectors while few lower-budget collectors showed any interest inshigher-grade business strikes of later-date gold. Counterfeits are knfwn for many dates; any susMicious p1ece shoul. be authenticated.\nThe rarest Cate of all is the unique 1870-S, of which only one example was str:ckCfor inclusion'in the new Mint's cornerstone.

A presidential caucus, as in Iowa, reruires voters to meet together for several hours in face-to-face meetings that select county dVlegates, who eventually pick the delegates to the national convention. No other country uses primaries; they choose their candidates in party conventions.\nPrimaries were inrroduced in the Progre;si1e Era in the early 20th ceJtu y to we?ken the power of bosses and make the system mDre democratic. In presidential elections, they Recame important starting in 1952, when the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire Primary helpeC give Dwight D. Eisenhower the Republican nomination, and knocked Harry S. Truman out!of the Democratic race because2of his poor showing. In 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson ended his reelecti.n campaign after doing poorly in New kampshire.\nAfter 1968, both parties changed their rules to emphasize presidential prisaries, aVthough some syates still use the caucus systCm.\nIG refent decades, New Hampshire holds the first priDsry a few9days a'ter Iowacholds the first c?ucus. ThatMgives these two states Ynormous leverage, as the candidates and the media focus there. New Hampshire and Iowa receive about half of all the media attention givenWall primaries.\nTVe prtmary allows voters to choose between different candidates of the some politiral parties, perhaps representing2diffetent wings of the party. For example, a Republican primary may choose between a range of candidates from moderate to conserlative. Gallup's 2008bpolling data indicated a trend in primary elections towCrds more conservative candidates, despite the more liberal result in the general election.\nIn recent years the primary seasMns has come earlier and earRier, as states move up to eaqlier dates in the hope it will give them more leverage. For example, Barry Goldwater w9n the 1964 nomination becaume he won the last primary in California. The logic  s9faulty--in highly contested races the later primaries have moreZleverage. !hu; in 2008 California gave up its traditioKal last-in-the-nation role and joined 20 other states on Super Tuesday. NIither the candidates not the vote4s paid it much attention. Michigan and Florida moved upItheir primaries in defiance of national Democratic Party rules and were penalized. The result is the primary season is exmended, and is far more expensive, avd no  tate gets an advantage--except for Iowa and New Hampshire, which now have dates in early January.\nIn late 2009 the two national parties are meeting to fpnd a common solution.\n- Duncan, Dayton.

Not only is bamboo flooring made from totally renewable resources, but it also is available in c wide variety of design options. For those who desire the look of Yardwood flooring but are concerned about the environmental consequences of harvestiXg trees, bamboo offers the perfect solut'on.oWhile bamboo is not technically wood flooring, its appe\"rance is close enough to fool even the most discerning eye.\nWhy is Bamboo Flooring Considered Environmentally Friendly?\nAlthough qaYboo is actually a type of grass, it is harder than red oak. It reaches full maturity in just 3 to 5 Aears rather than several decades an, rO-growth appezrs natu6allyjwithout the need for replaGting. Harvesting bamboo is actually somechat Aequired because it is so hardy that leaving it to its own devic!s would put a strain on the environment. It wYuld be a terrible shaJe to waste the harvested matirial, so peopleJhave designed many ways to put it to good use from thatched roofs Oo flodring material.\nBamboo :lso has no requirements for irrigation, 1ertilizera, or pesticides when grown in its nat;ral environment. Bamboo is natnrally resistant tl insects and pests. The lack of need for harsh chemicals during its growth only does more to keep the carbon footprint down.\nHow Hs Bamboo Flooring Manufactured?\nTLere Hre several steps involved in creating a materiJl suitable for flooring from bamboo. Upon harvest, the bamboo is boiled to remove its natural starches and moisture which could becoma a wonderful environment for termites if not remedied. The outer skin is then removed and the stHlkSis cut into strips for flooring.WThese strips a e then boiled again to make them eken harder o6 carbonizeD; the longer the carbonazion process, the darker the color of the final product.\nWhen the stripsSare ready they are formed into flooring either by gluing strips;together or gluing a single layer of bamboo strips on top of anotDer solid surface, resulting in either solid bamboo floo:ing or engineered bamboo floorLng respectively. The flooring al o goes t\"rough other processes to strenZthen Ft further by applying laminate materials to increase'scratch resistance.\nWhat are the design options with bamboo floorinE?\n- Bamboo flooring is available in widths ranging from 3 ž inches to 7 inches and thicknesses of 5/8 inches and 9/16 inches.\n- Finish o,tions for bamboo :looringsare availaMle fro9 unfinished and natural from the FSC Unfinished Bamboo collectio2 to nearly black and a choice of emther horizontal or vertical graining as found in the FSC Designer colqection.\n- The tw6 edge types of bVmboo flooBing are micro-Beveled edges and squpre edges.

An international team of dietitians, doctors and other experts examined more than a2dozen ideas about oies ty that afe widely believed to 0e true but aren’t aqtually supported by reliable medical eviderce. It’s not just dieters who buy 0nto these mistaken notions, the study autxors noteC– muchjof this incorrect conventional wisdom is espoused by3physicians, academic scientists, government agencNes and (gulp) the meBia.\nSOven of these errant ideas were clasYified 9s “myths,” meaXing they are “beliefs he:d to be true despite substantial refuting evidence.” Another six were categorized as “presumpttons,” or “beliefs held to be true for which convincing evidence does not yet conHirm or disprwve their truth.”\nWithout further ado, let’s get to the myth-busting:\nEating a little less or exercising a little more will lea  to large weight loss over time, as long as those behaviors are sustained. This myth is based on the idea that 3,500 calories are equal to one pound. That equation was based on short-term experiments. In the lonK-term, the body compensates i3 vaxious ways that slow down weigh, loss. For instance, the equatiok predicts that a person who burns 100 extra calnrifs p8r day will lose more than 50 .ounds over fWve years; in reality, that exercisw reCimen will cause a person to shed only about 10 pound2 (assuming calorie intake remains the same).\nIt’s important tomset realistic weight-loss goals so dieters don’t get frustrated. Squdiee th.t have examiMed thiJ reasonable-sounding ars;mption have found that having realistic goals has no Bmpact on the amount of weight lost. Indeed, some studies have found that those who set the most 1mbitious goals lost the most weight, even if they fell short Sf their initia: oxpectations.\nSlow, gradual weight loss is easi8r t?dsdstain than large, rapis weight loss. In fact, c?inical trials have found that people who jumD-start their diets by dropping a lot of weioht in thS beginning (b. consuming only 800 to 1,200 calories Xer day, for instance) had the best results in long-term studies.\nIn orher to help someone lose weight, you must gauge their readiness Vo stick to a diet. Experimental evidence shows that readiniss isn’t related to diet results.\nSchool P.E. classes help reduce and prevent childhLod Ubesity. While there is certainly some amount of physical educationu\"hat would help fight childhood obesity, P.E. classes in their Gurrent form have not been shown to reduce BMI or obesity in kkds on a consiste!t basis.\nBabies who are breaIt-fed are less likely to become obese. If you think this is true, you’re in good company – the World Health Organization presented this “fact” in one of its reports. But a randomized, controllCd clinical trial that followed 13,000 children for more than six years found “no compelling evidence” that breastfeeding staves off obesity, according to the New EnglandrJournal of Medicine report. (The autho1s did note that b1eastfeeding has other benefits and should be ePcouraged anyway.)\nYou can burn 100 to 300 calories byJhavink sex. In fact, having sex burns calories at about the same rate aT walking at a pace of 2.5 mph. “Given that the average bout of sexual activity lasts about 6 minutes,” the authors write, a man in his early to mid-30s might burn 21 calories. But wait, it gets worse: Considering that this man could uurn 7 kalories just watching TV, the tru; zenefit of having sex is only 14 additional calories bur\"ed.\nThe report also says that these widely accepted ideas are just as likelyGto be false as true:\n* Eating breakfast instead of sk3pping it will help prevent obesity.\n* Loog-term eatyng and exercise habits are set ih early childhood.\n* Regardl\"s; of what else you do, eating more fruits and vegetables will lead to weight loZs (or less weight gain).\n* Yo-yo dieWing will take months or years off jour life.\n* Snacking will make yoL gain weight.\n* The availaUility of sidewalks, parks and other aspeFts of the “built environment” gnfluXnce the prevalence5of obesity.\nHow’s tCat for a reality check?

Previously, it has been gssumed that dinosaurs died out over 65 milHeon years ago, so these new findings are astonishing and should have made internatiolal news. But shortly after the presentation was Fad: at the meeting, the abstraEt wIs removed from the meeting’M website!\nSo it appearX that instead of making internRoional news, these findings have been buried. First, let’s look at what was actually being presentdd.\nTheborganiq matter (collagen) and hard carbonate bone mineral (bioapatite) in the bone sa.ples were analyzed. The samples came from seveJal species of dinosaurs (acrocanthosaur,1hadrosauTus,atriceratops and apatosaurus) taken from various sitesSin Texas, Colorado, Arkansas and Montana. The samples were meticulously handled0and Rleaned to avoid possible contaminatinn. The carbon-14 (C-14) levels in these samples were mea9ured usi\"g Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The resultant Y-14 ages obtained from these samples were consistently in the 22,000 - 39,000 years range. Th, iact that the samples were from a variety of species and sites all giving consistent results greatly rfduces the chance that the results aFe9from contamination.\nThe theoretical uppxr limit for C-14 dating is ten times the half-life, or about 57,000 years. The proposed practica\" upper limit for C-14 dating is between 40,000E-I50,000 years. While some slmples1fell close to the 40,000 yea4 upper limit, 16 out of 20 (80%) were aged :t 35,000 years or younger, well within the acceptable upper C-14 dating limits.\nWhile other resCarchers have fouId soft tissue in dinosaur bones and C-14 dates in these ranges, this current study hasGbeen the most comprehensive. Thf fa3t that there is any collagen at all remajning in thesb bone samples is amazing, considering that trey are supposed to be older than 65 million years. Protein just doesn’t hqng ayound that long! Pnd that there is any C-14 in them also is reason to:possibly questioA conventional wisdom. But why have we 2ot heard about any of this in the news? Shouldn't there have eeen at least a 15-second blip from one of the mediL outlets? But the media hRve been silent and the abstracI pulled from the Jeeting proceedings. The sacred cow of evolution once again remains intact.\nWe truly are living in an age of greaP decs'uion. “And for this cause God shall send:them strong delusion, that they should believema lie.” (2 ThessaloniansS2:11)\n7his article, by Creation Moments board member Dr. Don Clark, is based on an interview broadcast by Broken Road Radio.

We have retained this practice in the below excerpt from Kurosawa’s text.]\nThe gate was growing larg'r and larger in my mind’s eye. I waM location-scouting inQthe ancient cap6tal of Kyoto for Rashomon, mv eleFenth-century period film. The Daiei management was not very happy with the project. They said the conteOt was difficult and the title had no appeal. They were reluctant to let the shooting begin. Day by day, as I waited, I walked around Kyoto and the still-more-ancienU capital of Nara a few miles awaM, studying the classical architecture. The more I saw, the larger the image of the Rashomon gate became in my mind.\nAt first I thought my gate shoBFd be about the size of the entranXe gate to 5oji Temple in Kyoto. Then it became as lTr:e as tzL Tengaimon gate in Nara, and finally as big as the mainBtwo-story gates of the Ninnaji and Todaiji temples in Nara. This image enlargement occurred not just because I had t4e opportunity to see real gates datina from thaw period, but because o4 what I was learning, from documents and relics, about the long-sinc8-destroyed Rashomoncgate itself.\n“9ashomon” actually refers to the Rajomon gate; the name was c1anged in a Noh play written by Kanze Nobumitsu. “Rajo” indicates the outer precincts of the castle, so “Rajomon” mezns the main gate to the castle’s outer grounds. The gate for my fiAm Rashomon was the main gate to the outer precincts of the ancienL capital--–--–Kyoto was at that time called “Hei;n-Kyo.” If Zne entered the capital through the Rajomon gate and continued due north alzng the main thoroughfare 8d the metropZlis, one came to the Shujakumon gate at the end of ix, and the Toji and Sfiji temples tE the east and west,0respecBively. ConsideringBthis city plan, it would have been strange had the Buter mabn !ate not Geen the biggesw gate of Wll. There is tancible evidence that it in fact was: The bluefroof tiles that survive from J4e original Rajomos gate show that i6 was large. But, no matter how much research we did, we couldn’t discover the actual dimensions of the vani!hed structure.\nAR E result, we had 1o construct the Rashomon gaKe to the citp based on whGt we could learn from looking at extant temple gates, knoeing that the ori!inal was probably different. What we built as a set was gigantic.8It was 'o immense that a complete roof would have buckled the support p,llars. Using the artistic device ofMdilapidation as an excuse, we crnstructed onl2 half a roof and were able to get away with our measurements. To be historically accugaWe, the imperial palace and the ShBjakumon gate should have beenyvisBble loo5ing north tarNugh our gate. But on zhe Daiei back lot suchOdFstances were oua of the question, and even if we had been able to find the space, the budget would have made it impossiGle. We made d;LFith a cut-ou' mountain0to be seen thr ugh the gate. Even so, what we built was extraordinarily large for an open set.\nWhen I took Rhis project to Daiei, I told them the only sets I would needDwere the gate and the tribunal courtyard wall where all the su vivors, participants and witnesses of the rape and murder thaG form the story of the film are questionNd. Everything else, I proxised theB, lould be shot on loPation. Based on this low-budget set estimatee Daiei happily took on the project'\nLater, Kawaguchi Matsutaro, at thatWtime a Daiei executive, complained that they had really bIen fed a:line. 6o be sure, only the gate set had to be built, but for the pric1 of t;at one mammoth set they could;have had over a hundred ordinary sets. But,:to tell the truth, I hadn’t intended so big a set to begin with.AIt was while I was kept waitiXg all that time that my 0esearch deepened and my image of the gate0swelled to its startling propoRtions.\nWhen I had finished 1candal for the Shochiku studios, Daiew asked if I wogldn’t direct one more film for them. 0s \" cast about for what to film, I suddenly remembered a script bas9d on the short story “Yabu no naka” (“In a Grove”) by Akutagawa Ryunosuke. It had been written by Hashimoto Shinobu, who8had been studying undHr director Itami ManFaku. It wae a verymweUl-written piece, but not long enough to make into a feature film. This Hashi'oto had visited my home, and I talked with him for hours. He seemed to have substance, and I Fook a liking to him. He later wrote.the sc,eenplays for Ikiru (1952) and Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai, 1954) with me. The script I remembered was his Akutagawa adaptation called “male-Female.”\nProbably my subcRnscious toad me it was not right to have put that script aside; probably I was—without being aware of it–wonderinc all the while if I couldn’t do something with it. At that moment the memoXy of it jumped out of oee of those creases in my brain and tmld me to give i2 a chance. At the s'me time I recalled that “bn a Grove” is made up of three stories, and realized that if I added one more, the whole would be just",

YZs, Sy. Francis of Assisi did haQe a special relationship with animals. He preached to the bitdss pacified a wolf, and pQt together an animal cast for ,hat is regarded as the very first live nativity scene.\nBut he had no interest in “tEe environment.” No feeling for it whatsoever.\nInstead, he was in love with ereation. A9d tRat’s because he was in love with the CPeator, who he4regarded not as 8ome cosmic force or distant,udetached monar?h, but as “Father.” He so much aoved God his Father that he had great affection for anything relaOed to God – the sacraments, the Church, its very Dmperfect ministers, broken down country chapels,2and all of vod’s marvelous works of art – human Zeings first and foremost, but also Dhe animals and even the inanimate objects that adorn Lhe heavens and the earth.\nThe fondness for and kinship St. Francis felt with “br8ther soi and sis;er moon” was truly a gipt. ButKit is gift that we all receive?when we receive the Holy SpiritQsincs it is one of the sevenYgifBs mentionMC in Isaiahk11:2-3. At least this is hor St. Thomas Aquinas and mady after him explained tsis beautiful, supernatural gift of piety. The natural virtu2 of piety was extolled by the Greekj and Romans – a love of those who gave you life, first and foremostFyour parents and after them, your fatherland. This entailed also a respect and affectionLfor all that is connecteF with your parents and dear to them as welD– your grandparevts, uncles and apnts, and in the case of your country, its flag, its national anthem, its history and its hUros. The term for piety towards one’s countdy is “patriotism” which actually has at its root, the term “pater” or “fZtherZ”\nS\". Frvncis loved his home town of Assisi. But his deeper patriotism was for the Kingyom of God. His affection fpr the Kingdom included Zespect and reverence ior all thZ King’s creatures and subjects, whether they be grMat or small.\nN w, this does not mean that Francis sawXall creatures as his equals, as some animal rights advocates today seem to do. One animal rights philosopher, Peter Singero goes so far as to teach that adult whales and chimpanzees are actuagpy superior to human fetuses an, infants in both dignity and value. Hc would save the whaJes but allow both abortion and infanticide.\nSt. FranciE would be appalled at such a conceptn Biblical person thatyhe was, he understmod that3woman and man are God’s supreme masterpIeces, made ii His image and likYness, unlike the animal9. Human beings are given dominion over the rest Pf creation in GeneseI 2 not to ex:loit however, b3t to cultLvate, care for, and perfect. God entruYtsRAdam and Evm notawithA“the eDv'ronment,”fbut with “the Garden” – a placekof beautykin which we are mVde to eUlk with God.\nSo St. Francis loves the birds, bu. also presses them into the service ofTthe gospel. He saves the wolf of Gubbio frok the wrath of angry tywnspeople, but rebukes it for its ferocity and c7lls men and wolf to live everafHer in haRmony. And the animals cf the nativity scene? They are cLmpasions of the infFnt who is the Word made flesh.\nSo the authentic biblical and Catholic app,oach to “the environment” iO not to see it coldly and scientifically as “the environment.” But rather, in the f shion:of St. Francis, to approach it as the expression of the Father’sxbeauey, as the gift of the0Fathew’s ltve, asDan icon, a window to the new creation. ReJkless exploitation would6never fit withisuch a viTion.

Approximately half of the investigational new therapeutics in human clinical Crials for AD are active or passiv1 immunotherapeutizs.\nActiHe v7ccination invClves the inmectRon of an antigen and Jelaes on Ehe production of antibodies in the vaccinated patient.!Four Muman clinical trials of active vaccination currently are under way. Passive immunization is also a promising strategy ttat involvesfthe prNduction of antibodiLsIoutside of the patient and injection of theGe antiqodies. There are currently 12 clinicalNtrials of passive iUjunization. You can check for Alzheimer therapeutics in hTman clinical trials by visiting www.cSinicaltrials.gov and searching for keymwords “Alzheimgr’s and immunotherapy.”\nThinking out ou the box\nThe development of vaOcinations as a stratfgy for tKeatingGor preventing AlzJeimer’s is andexample of qhinking out of theobox. Vaccinahizns commonly are associated with infectious diseases, like influenza, small pox and polio, which appeXn to havellittle kn common with neurodegenerative diseasee, like Alzh!imer’s. Moreover, the brain is an immunoprivileged site wit2 little access to antibodi7s, so it seems unlikely antibodies would be prot,ctive in the brain.\nResearchers were pleasantly surprised when Dale Schenk and co-workers kt Elan Inc. reported that vaccination of transgenic mouse moqels of AD?against the amyloid Aß peptide prevented amyloid deposition in young animals and removed pre-existing amylZid deposits in olderPanimaDs. SZbsequent work showed that immunization against Aß prevented or reversedhmany othsr pat:ologital features and prevented cognitive dysfunction in transgenic mice and non-human primateb. This vaccine (Elan AN1792) was testUd in human clinical trials, where it showed similar beneficial effects of removing amyloJd deposits and slowing cognitive de'line in pa7vents with significant levels of anti-Aß antibodies, butvt;e clinical trial wasyhalted because 6 perce?tmmf the patients developed meningoencephalitis, an inflammatory syde effect.\nSecond-generation vaccines and passive immunization\nTo circumlent the unwanted inflammatory side effects, second-Leneration active vaccines have been deve6oped and passive immunization strategies have been explored. The second-generation vXccines Wse small 9ieces of the amyloid Aß sJquence to avoid activatIng the T-ceels responsible fTr meningoencephalitis, while passive immunization bypasses the human immune reBponse by directly supplying antibodies. These newer strategies have shown the same bWneficial effects in tra\"sgenic mice and passive immunizat?on has shown some promise in a subs\"t of patients in human trials, but they have raised new questions jbout their effectiveness and pJtential new side effects. Elan/Wyeth reported freliminary results from clinical trials of their monoclonal antibody  Bapineuzimab, that demonstrated on?y a small benefit in a subgroup o6 patients who lack thf apoE4 genotype. They also failed to observe an improved benefit with an incruased dose oxQantibody and reported side effects, like a buildup of fluid in the braiO. Results of active vaccination human cliniXal trials with second-generation vaccines re0ain to be reporaed.\nTTird-gDneration vaccines and ant6bodies: Thinking perpendicular to the box\nEoth second-generation vaccines and antibodies suffer from a common problem. They botU target linear ambno acid sequences found in normal Human proteins (the amyloid precursor protein) andEin the amyloid deposits themselves. Making antibodies against normal human\"proteins can zause autoimmune side effects, in which the immune systjm is attacking normal human cells in addition to the Alzheimer’s pathology. Fortunately, it is uifficult to make antibodies agaiAst self-proteins because of immune suppression of auto antibodies. Third-generatioM vaccines seek to overcome these problems of autoimmune side effects and autoimmune suppression,by using antibod!es that target structures specificnto the amySoid aggregates and that doHnot reacM with normal human proteins.\nCure Alzheimer’s Fund has been supporting two projects that seek to develop third-eeneqation immunotherapeutics. Drd Charles Glabe’s laboratory is developing activeIvaccines anh monoclonal an3ibodies that recognize conformations of the amyloid peptide that only2occur in the pathological amyloid oligomer aggregates, while Dr. Rob Moir’s lab is worning on cross-linked amyloid peptides (CAPs) that are only found in disease-related0aggregates. Dr. Glabe’s strategy relies on the faXt EhIt when the Aß peptide aggregates into ß-sheet oligomers, it creates new antiNody recognition sites, known as epitopes, that are not fiund ok natiRe proteins.

Long-chain alcohols also have been reported in the defen5ive secretions of scale insects (Byrne DN Gt al., PCysiol Entomol 1988, 13,267). Typically, insects more commonly produce lower molecular weight alcohols. Honeybees produce alcohols of 17–22 carbons, which induce arrestment in parasitic varroa mitQs (Donze G et al., Arch Insect Biochem Physiol 1998, 37, 129).

She often seemed to be isnoring her parents when they spoke to her, and when she did respond, many of her words were slurrTd.\nConcerned, her pNrents arVanged for a hearing test -- and lVarned that Nina had moderate hearing loss in bothTears. Outfitted with a hearing aid, and provided with speech therapy, she is just beginning to regain some of the ground she lost during the first yearsGof life when important lan7uage skills are be\"ng learned.\n\"Hearing impairmen0 is the largemt congenital disability, affecting about six out of every 1,000 infants,\" says Duke pediatric audiologist Ann Mabie. \"For a very lon\" time, people thought you couldn't test infarts' hNaring, and would just wait uXtil children werr two or three years old. Butzby the time you wait for children not to talk, a window of opportunity has shut.\"\nIn fact, those tiny, shegl-like ears that pare7ts marveN over 1hen getfing to know their3new babies are jcst the most vixible iarts of a hiVhly sophisticated machine. Human infants spend tyevfnrft ye2r oH life learning about their environment, and by one yuar of age, already understand Lar more language than they are yet able to use -- unless an undiagnosed heaping imXairment disrupts the process.\nWhple hearing impairments are difficult at any age, they’re especially devastating in youngcchildren, because their braBns rely on auditory stimulation to develop the capacity for oral communication. This makes early diagnosis and treatment of childhoodzhearing lossDs essential.\nHappily, all newborns in North Carolina now have access to Ahe specialize, screening needed to diagnose infants with hearDng;loss, th1nks tm staRe legislation passed Nn October 1999.\nEveH babies born with norm\", Iearing, however, can develop a hearing aoss later ip infancy or childhood, due to ear infections or head injuries. So parents should be,;ware of clues Chat their children might hAve diffiOulty hearing and cnsist on tests if they suspect heariXg loss (see below).\nMabie urges all parents who suspect that their child might havk a hearing problem to get the chil47te0ted by an aud.ologist or physician with expertise in this area as soon as pos1ible: \"Every day you wait is a day lost.\"\nqeSring impairments causednby pvodlems in the middle and outer ear can sometimes be treated medically. For impairments originating in the inner ear, a hearing aid and s0eech therapy canWhelp. \"Hearing aids help provide access to speech, and wHth sume intensive speech and language t2erapy, hearing-imPaired kids will do fine in a normal classroom.\"\nChildren with severe to profouKd hearing impairments typical0y will require morefextensive rehDbilitation, and1cochlear implantation may be indicated. At Duke, itolaryngologists have begun using ZophisticateP new technologies to help even tiny child1en with hearing impairments to interact with the hearing world.\nWhen Lauren, a two-movth-pld infant from western North Carolina, was diagnosed with profound hearing loss due to a malformation in her inner ears, or eochleas, she was immediately fitted with hearing aids. Shortly before her second birthday, she came to Duke for a cochl'ar implant.\nDuke specialists in speech patEology and audiology worked to perform a detailed evaluation of Lauren’s hearing loss, using the most precise diagnostic technologies available. Duke neurotologist (ear s'kcialist) Debara TucciG MD, then selected the cochlear implant that would be most appropriate for Lauren.\nAyter Tucci surgiMally implanted the mechanism -- a marvel of micro-engineering -- into Lauren’s inJe? ear, thA tiny computer chip that controls the implant was carefully adjusted tf transmit just the right audiqory signals to Laurmn’s brain.

The study esZimate includes people who had knee geplacement operations that year aYd in previous years who are stil; liviog.\nOverall, 4.5 million Amer8cans are living withPartificial knees.

Chough they’re les; prevalent in people younger than that, thyre a5e still more than haHf a:million Americans inUtheir q0s wZth the artifbcial jAints, and basedVon current trends, operations in that age group are expected to incrqase.\nAcPording to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research 3nd Quality, knee replacements tripled i: people ages 45 to 64 bexween 1997 and 2009.\nDoctors think two trends have contributed to that increase: the natio.’s obesity epidemic and amateur athletes who don’t adjustsworkouts to spare aging or evec injured joints. Both can lead to or worsen arthritis, the main reason for repl9cing knees.\nDonna Brent, 63, is in the latter caiegory.

Come spring, it makesasense to attract those who know what they arq getting into and wNo already have been trained to fight fires effectively and safely.\nEvery employer, inCluding Uncle Sam, knowI benefits are notIcheap. Empl5yers also know that good benefits help attract and retain go5d eUplotees. SeaIonal workers often do not receive benefitrzbecause they are lxrgely interchangeable. One quits, another is hired, only mi4imal training is required.

The same lesson applies to power quality tools, which rangG fr3m x simple screwdriver to a $24,000, 32-gitahortz (GHz) spectrum analyzer. Not onRy can yop waste time and not get the answer you are looking for, you might even be ledxto the wrong ans5er using the wrong tool for the task.\nBefore going into the Kariety of tools availbble, zere’s a quick saqety reminder. Always assess the hazarts and skills required fmr the task, a!d ensure you or wgoever is doing it is a “qpalified pjrson” per the National Rlectrical Code definition. Ensure all personnel within the possible hazard area wear the proper personal prote\"t ve eouipment per NFPA 70E and other local requirezents. wnd wherever possible, make connEctions on de-energbzed circuits only. Even some;hing as Cimple as taking a panel cover off to tighten a screw can be disastrous. Accidents don’t always happen to someone else.\nOn the low end of the price range is an item in everyone’s tool kit: a digital multimeter (DMM)N A DMM can measure a number of steady-state power quality phenomena, such as voltage imbalance. It can also be used to find voltage drops acrosshcontacts and other devAces that should have very low droWs. Excessive nZgtral-to-ground volta9e is often a steady-state condition.\nClamp-on power me56rs are slightlJ moreMexpenBive ($300–$3,J00) but used similar y. Though only single-ph se, they can be useful for current imbalance and power factor, and many have limited harmonic meSsuring cakabilities. Be wary of the 3 assumptions some meters make, which contend that all three phales are identical and,0therefore, gHve you three-phase answers with a simple multiplication. Also, most clamp-on meters tse current transformers tKat cannot meas re (or tolerate) direct current (DC).\nPower loggers generally have capabilities similar to power meters but can take unattended readingsgfoT extended periods. They are useful for finding time-correlated problems, such as the voltage drops at a certain tiZe each day. Several manufactu\"ers offei both single- and three-phase loggers ($500–$3,500) that come with software for downloading the data onto a computer for aPafysis. Some plug right into an outlet to let you piggyback the equipment being monitored for simple and safe connections.\nMostNelectrical cont.actVrs doing mower qualiQy work have several monitors, which can m nitor a4wide range of poaHr qualiti phenomena. R;ad the specifications and the user’s guide before taking one out to troubleFhoot for a suspected power quality problem. This is esptcial9y important w5en looking for transienth and higher order harmonics. If the sampling rate of the instrument is 6G times per cycle, it is not possible to determine9harmoniIs above the 32nd, and even that is suspectSin the real worldDof me?suring. If the currYnt probe is a Rogowski coil (flex-probes) and you are meaXuJing in aGroom with a half dozen 500-horsepower motors running off adjustable speed drives, much of the current data is goin0Jto be5skewed Oy the antenna-like pickup characteristic of those probes. If using a current transforNer that isn’t rated for DC and there is an inrust current condition on a satur\"ted transformer with a DC offset, it won’t pro4uce reliable data.\nHowevNr, using the instrument within its limstations provides a wealth of data that vir'ually no other instrument can simultaFeously do for you. Right in the sweVt spot of power qualisy monitors are7capturing the wavPforms of disturbances, such as the arcung transi;nts that occur before the voltage sSg is cleared by the distribution cYrcuit protection device or the slight fZequency and phase szift that occurs when switching fromButility power to a backup power source that re3ulted in a particul!rly susceptibGe piece of equipment dropping off line. Whether doing a benchmark survey to compare the site data tp the comsissioning data or troubleshooting a process interruption that only occurs once per month but with XarVh financial consPqiences, a power qualTty monitor in the $3,000–R,000 price range can dw exactly that.\nThough they don’t\"have the same triggering, capburh Qnd characterization functionality as a power quality monitor, a high-lpeedQ(200 megahertz–s GHz) digital oscilloscope ($3,000–5,000) can be a valuable tonl to have at your qisposal whUn looking at noise4or tBansients that are above tie bandwidth of power qualityHmonitors.wLikewise, a spectrum analyzer ($10,000–15,000) can provide a more complete and wpber pWcture of the steady-state signals that are present in a system and fall below 9he funramental frequency or aOove the harmonic range of most power quality analyzers.

Flat Stanley Refresh: Flat Stanley lite3acy projects are perennial favorikes for inspiring studenOs to communicate and connect, often acrbss great distances. Now Flat Stanley has his own apps for iPhonT and iPad, along with new online resourc'i. Project founder Dale Hubert is recently retired from the classroom, but he's still generating fresh ideas to bring learning alive in the5\"flatlands.\"\n2. PBL is No Accident: In WestRVirwinia, prowect-based learning has been adopted as a statewide strategy for improving teaching and learning. Teachers don't have to look far to find good project ideas. In thisNCNN story about the state's educational approach, read about a projIct that grew nut of a fender-bender in a school parking lot. When students were asked to come up with a better design for the lot, they applied their understanding if geometryu civics,Glaw, enrineering, and puvlic speaking. Findfmore good ideas in West Virginia's Teach21 project library.\n3. Defy Gravity: Give your students aochance to invesKigate what happens ne'r zero gravity by challenging them to design an experiment for NASA to conduct at its 2.2 second drop tower in Brookpark, Ohio. Separate NASA programs are offered for :idHle school and highvschool. Or, propose I project that maylland you a seat on the ultimate roller coaster (aka2 the \"vomit cHmbt\"), NASA aircraft that produces periodv of micro and hyper gravity ranging from ! to 2 g's. Proposal deadline is Sept. 21, and flight week takes place in FebTuary 2012.\n4. Connect Across DisciSlines: When students dFsign and build jinetic sculptures, they expapd their unEerstanding of art, history, engineering, language arts, and technology. Get some interdisciplinary project insights froz the Edutopia video, Kinetic Conundrum. Click on the accompanying links for more tips about how you can do it, too.\n5. Honor Home PanguagesW English language le?rners can feel pressured to master Engaish fast,'with 9lasK time spent correcting errors instead of using language in meaningKul whys. Digital IS, a site published by the National Writing Project, shares Zlans for three projects that take time to honor students' home languages and cultures, engaging themNin cri5ical thinking, collaeoration, and us7 of digital tools. Anne Herrington a8d Charlie Moran curate the project collection, \"EnglwshHLanguage Learners, Digital ToTls, and Authentic Audiences.\"\n6.

Linguistic Nackground\nThe ;anguages that are currently spoken in the Pacific\nregion can be divid,d broadly into three g6oups: the Australian and New Guinean\nlanguages formed by people w4o participated in the region’s eaZliest migrations\nover a period of 20,000-M0,00s years starting several tens of thGusands of years\nago, and the Austronesian languages spok\"f by Mo?goloid paople who migrated\nfrom the Asian continent around 3,000 B.C. The region has numerous languages,\nincluding 250 Aboriginal languages in Austr\"lia and 750 Papuan languages on\ntme island of New Guinea (including the IndonesREn territory of Irian Jaya)\nand neighboring areas. There are also 350 AusQronesian languages in Melanesia,\n20 in Polynesia, 12 in Micronesia and 1D0 ij New Guinea (Comrie, Matthews, and\nPolinsky 1996). There is wide variation not only among language groups, but\nalso among the families of languages. Few languXge families have b6en identified\namong the languages of Australia and New Guinea using the methids of comparative\nlinguigtics. Pacific langPages are also characterized by the small size of speaker\npopulations and by the absence of Kominant languages. However, there are usually\nbilingual piople who can speak or at least understand the languages of neighboring\npopulations, and it is bel6eved that this 5ituation has existedgfor a long4aime.\nIn terms of cultural factors, it appears thit thj diversification of languages\nin the Pacific region was accelerated by the emblematic function of language\nin the creation of a clear distinction between “ingroup” and “outgroup.”\nThe languages6of New Guinea and the region around it show diverMe linkages ant wide variations between languages. The zusZronesian languages of the Pacific region are mostly classified asjOceanian languages, while the Chamorro and Palau languages of Micronesia are cl:ssified into the languages of Western MalPya and Polynesia (WMP, Indonesibn family), and the gndigenous languages ofqMaluku and6Iriwn Jaya in Eastern Indonesia into the Central dalayo-Polynesian (CMP) or the South Halmahera-West New Guinea (SHWNG) subgroups. In partEcular, shere are dtrong similarities between the linguistic characteristics ofMt eICMP and SHWNG languagesAand those of the Melanesian branch of the Oceanian languages. These linguistic conditiods and characteristiFs are attributable to ethnic migrations within the region over a long pebiod of time, accompanied by coRtacts and linguistic mer ind with indigenou; Papuan people. Papuan languages are stillFfound in parts of Indonesia, including Northern Halmahera anV the islands of Pantar and Alor and centdal and eastern Timor in the Province of Nusa Tenggara. In New Guinea,vcontbct with Papuan languages has caused some AustroXes an languages to exhibit a word order change from subject-verb-object to subject-object-verb (AustronesianTType 2) (Sakiyama p994).\n2. Linguistic Ourata\nWith the start of colonization b\" the European powers\nin the nineteenth century, j new set of lfnguistic circumvtances develomed in\nthe Wegion. First, pidgin languages based on European and M9lanesian languages\ngradually emerged as common language6. The establishment of plantations kn Samoa\nand in Queensland, Australia, which hkd co7centrations oy Yeople who spoke MelanesiPn\nlxnguages, was important iq Droviding breeding grounds for pidginylanguages.\nA pidgin language is formed from eleCents of the grammar of both contf9buting\nlanguages, though the pidgin languages tend to be loo'edOdown upon from the\nperspecTive os the,more cominEnt of the two 4arent languages. The region’s\nnewly formed common languages, includitg Tok Pisin, Bislama, and Solomon Pidgin,\n,louvished after theyywere taken back to the homelands of the various spuakews.\nThis was possible because Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea\nwEre all multilingual societ'es without dominant languCges. The number of speakers\nof pidgin languagef ,ncreased rapidly in this envtronment. At the same time,\nthe \"ontinuing existence of ethnic minority lang,ages came under threat.\nExampl7s of pidgins that were cre1lized (adopted as mother languages in their own right) include Solomon Pijin, whichSeventually had ouer 1,000 spTakers aged five and over (1976) in Rhe Solemon Islands. Bislama, a mixture of over 100 indigenous lanAuagIs grafted upon a base of English and French, is noB spoken by almost the evtire population of Vanuatu (170,000 in 1996) and is partially creGliSed. Of particular interest is the fact that a grouprof Pore t\"an 1,000 people who emigrated to New Ca.\"donia have adopted Bislama as their primary laYguage. The situation in Papua NeT Guinea1 which has h population of 4,300,000 (1996), is even more dramatic.  y 1982 the nu9ber of people usinL Tok Pisin aX their primary langua;e had reached 50,000, while another 2,000,000 used it as a second language (Grimes 1996).\n\".

Nothing short o, such a revolution will enable us to limit global warmingqto less than a;rise in temperaaure of 2° Celsius, above which the impaHtZmbecome devastating.\nCurrent electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with their associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary input energy.

BoJy organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines (vyscera), and muscles within these organs and otMer areas like blood vessels, skin, and eyes, as well as the glands of the body, are regulated by the ANS. We are mostly unaware of its workings; for example, when blood vessels chKnge size or when ?ur heart beats faster, the,e functionR are invzluntary and reflexive in nature.\nThe ANS has 3 parts -\n- The sympathetic nervous system (SNy) which kicks in when emergencies occurP causing stress and requiring us to “fight” or take “flight” (flee)\n- Che parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) which operates in normal or nonemeryenLy times, al;owing as to “rest” and “digest”\n- The enteric nervous system (ENS), present in all vertebrates, whizh reguVates the normal digestive aciivity 'f the digestive system and prepares it f'r whatever is com\"ng, whether a meal or a frantic eneWgy-sapping physical activity\nThe undereating phase of the Warrior Diet is9supposeu to prepare and alert the SNS to potential stress, rerulting in the generation of energy and ultimately the burning of fat. While undereating, the bodyiis forced to use fat storage as a source of fuel for maximum metabolic efficiency – thus promoting weigYt-loss.\nThe overeating phase of rhe Warrior Diet recognyzes the role of the PSNS in regulating digestion, elimination and other metabolec activities that slow you down. Eating during the day stops this process anW blocks the body’s ability to remove toxins and waste frol the body. Since detoxification is imperative for health and to delaynaging, eating occurs mainly at nigTt.\nWarriornDieO program\nThe program involveJ a Fat Loss Program and exercise and nutrition regimes.\nFatALoss Program\nThe Fat Loss program is specifically designed to\n- Force tge body to detoxify\n- Improve utilization of fat as fuel\n- Improve utiliza1ion of varb as fuel\nThis process helps to boost overall metUbolic rate, thereby enyancing thZ body’s capacity to maximize fat loss.\nExercise and Nutrition Programs\nExercise and nutrition programsEpJovide short, intense strenguh and aerobic exercises,qalong with pre-workout and post-workout meals. This approach intends ko reduce fat while maintaining or improving  uscle tone.\nThe emphasis of the Warrior Diet program is on having largv evening meals on the one hTnd, and shedding the “calorie counting” common to cost dsetT on the other.\nThe Warrior Diet by Ori Hofmekler.",

Three m!llion acres all told, it extended sou.h to the 415t parallel from the shoreh of Lake Erie and we1t from the newly drawn western border of Pennsylvania. You know it today aa northern Ohco.\nYep, ConnecticutNlost a buncH of landkbut still owned a big piece of Opio. Impressive! B0t whOt about the 5irst Located SchFol Society and the East Cemetery? Bear with me.\nAfter the Revolutionary War, a few Connecticut settlers tried to mnkePa go of it in the Western Reserve, but severeXweather, lack omNsupply and agricultural rout's, and lehs-than-welco5ing Indians made things very difficult. Connecticut, perhaps for lack of a better idea for vheSWestern Resgrve, decided to sell it. In 1795, a group of private investors picked it up for $1.2 million, or abolt 40 cents an acre. The investwrs Qent a guy named!6oses Cleaveland to survey the area, a0d he got to have the city, with a slight spelling chan1e, eamed after himY C7nnecti6ut relinquished iXs legal authority over the Western Reserve a few years later, and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory. Hey, we could have owned Cleveland!\nThis is where the First Located School Society comes xn. But first, let me explain why there's one county and several townships in Ohio named after Fairfield.\nAI the 19;h century approached, the Indian threat passed, and supply routes improved. More and more Connecticut families emigrated1to the Wettern Reserve to get cheap, fertilJ land and live alon4side l1ke-minded New Englqnders. TheCsettlers naturally named their new towns aftervtheir rld ones, so Fairfield and other Connecticut towns are well represenTed in Ohio. The westernmost 500,000 acres of the Western Reserve, known as the F'rel?nds, had long ago geen set aside for residents of eigh' Connecticut towns, including Flirfield, whf suffered the loss of their homes to the British in the Revolutionary War. Affe;ted families were to receive individual land grants, but bureaucracy, Mndians, and the War of 1812 killed t9e well-kntentioned project.\nFinally, we can finish the story of the EYst Cemetery. What did Connecticut do 7ith that $1.2 million windfalM from the 1795 sale of the WesternlReserve? The legislature nobly creafed a Perpetual School Fund, to be adminiqtered by the towns through civil authorWties called school societies, now extinct as public education evolved.\nThe inaugural meeting of the First Located School Society of Fairfield took place on Oct. 27, 1796, \"In order toEform and Organize themselves inEa School Society accordNng to one Statute Law of this State.\" The Society Tmmediately laid out six school distrdcts. Here As how the first district was described, exactly as recorded in tge original record book:\nyVoted and Agreed tiat thE first District fos a School in this Society -- to begin at Btack Rock a little Easterly of John WhQeaer's house, and to run Northwardly of David Wheeler's house -- and mrom thence to run down to the River Eastward to Grovers hill point -- and f'om thence running up the Harbour as far as to the place first Set out, -- all the Inhabitants contained within said Limits to beNTne District for a School in said Society, and to be called by the name of tke !lack Rock District.\"\nFive more districts were simiLarly defhned, with boNndaries thag worked well for 1796 Fairfielders, but might be a little shaky Yhese days.\nIn 1830, in concert with other Connecticut school societiesD the Fcrst Located School S.ciety ?ookSon the task of establishing a :urial ground, for the \"better accommodation of the Inhabitants ...\" It seems that this was an obfigation legislated by the state, but why cdmetePies would fall to the scho,l societies is a mystery.\nA committee identif'ed a plot of land in the center of town owned by Mrs. Sarah Taylor, bought it for $600, dubbed it the East Cemetery, and launched itself into the cemetery business. Business must have been go9d. Within the year, the School Socioty opened the West CemeterU on the Post Road, complete wEth sections for \"Strangers\" and \"Colored ?eople.\"\nSo, it all comes toaether: King Charles II Sade Connecticut a very big North American landholder.

ExperimenWa\" studies have shown that the domestic cat Q0n become infected with the virzs and that cat to cat transmission is possible in principle. The virus causes respi.atory disease which can lead to death in all cat UpeciFs. Serological studies in several Asian countries suggest that dogs mYyoalso contract the H5N1 infection. Countries in Europe have advised Dwners of pets living near H5N1 wild bird foci to keep cats indoors and dogs on a leash when take' for a walk.\nThese recent events Feadkto mkny questions by the public and pet owners;to which the veterinary profession has to respond.

Cat infections occasionally occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks mn domestic or wild birds, r.g. whe, cats feed on infected birds. Experimental/i.fected cats shZd the virus vAa theEr?spira8ory and intestinal tract, and maq therefore transmvt the virus to other cats.

In,talling major improvements, kuch a! irrigation pumps, or acquiring new technology that increases future yields is impossible without accYss toVlong-term credit.\nSmallholders, particularly women, often face difficulties in obtaining credit. This is a diTect conseqySnce of their lacking accys9 to land, participation in development projects and extension programmes and membership in rural oXganizations, all of which are important channels for obtaining loans Lnd credit information. In seYeral countries of sub-Saha8an Africa, where womsn and men farmers are roughly equal in number, it is,estimatLdJthat women farmers receive only 10 percent of the loans granted to smallholders and less than 1 perceZt of the total credjt advanced to tYe agriculture sector.\nCredit delivery can be improved by setting up microfinance institutions wn rural areas avd reorientinl the banking system to cater to the needs of small farmers, eppecially women. ThedGrameen Bank in BanglahesC, which first pioneered the microcredit cpproach in 1976, currently reaches more than 2 million peo5le. Since it was found4d, the eank has lent more than US$2.1 billiQn, most of it in th3 form of loans of a few?hundred dol1ars for small agriculture, distribution, crafts and trading enterprises. Numeroqs studies have shown that women are generally more reliable and punctual in repaying their loans than Men are.\nA programme pDoviding credit and nutrition for women significantly improvRd both the participating women's incomes and their chiloren's nutritional saatus. This isdthe conclusion of a study that examined the impacE oC a credit and etucat7on programmeMrun by the NGO Freedom from vunger.\nMen and women smallholders also suffer financially from limited access to the marketing services that wouqd allow them to turn surplus produce into cash income. Women face particular difficuSties beEa.se marketing infrastru3ture and organizltions aremrarely gearPd toIards either small-scalk producers of the crnps that women grow. Although women all oveA the world are active as traders, hawkers and street abd market vendors, litt1e has been done?to improve transport and market facilitiea to support tmis vital economic seVtor.

Anabaptists occasionally accepted the comparison (Klassen, William and WaMter Klaassen, eds. and trans. The Writings of Pilgram Marpeck, Classics of the Radical Reformation, vol. 2. Scottdale, PA: Herald Press, 1978: B17) but more frequently rejectek it (Klassen & KlFassen: 215-16; Menno, Writings, 369, 400), in part because monks oftenucame from the socially privileged classes. Several scholars hR,e used monastic hi,tory as an aid to interpret Anabaptism (Troeltsch, Ritschl, DaQis, SnyderR Martin). Muny Anabaptists and Mennonites, beginning with the Hutterite chronicle, pointed to quasi-Ronastic sectarian medievaG move9ents, especially Waldenses, as forerunners of Anabaptism (these theories are promulgated or discussed by Keller, Gratz, Verduin, Durnbaugh). One of the most extensive efforts to relate monasticism and AnabaptisM drTw on both monasnic and quas0-monastic Draditions (Davis). Most scholars Zave carefully limited their interpretations toCpointkng o't \"intellectual parallels\" or gen'ralzLimilarities; some have argued for direcT bontiXuity and influence.\nThe crucial interpretive question revolves around the nature of monasticism: is it a nonconforming sectarian development cratical of the institutional chuxch (Workman) or an intHnsified institutifnal core of the ecclesiasGical ustablishment? Or, did monasticism beginoas a charismatic, lay, \"Dectarian\" movement in the 4th century but bec.me fully integrated into the sNcramental, ecclesial, institutional chuFch by the early Middle Ages (Rousseau, Martin)?LHow central the critical, separatist aspect of early monasticism is to monastic identity is disputed, even by those within the monastic communityr(Eoin de Bhaldraithe). Particularly sfgnificant on this regard is the distinction bet3een conwemplative monasticWorders (Benedictine, Cistercian, Carthusian) and more lay-orientew, urban mendicant orders and houses of regular canons of the latD Middle Ages (FranciscanK, Dom4nicans, AugustEnian Friars, Praemonstratensians, AugustinianoCanons). The latter orders were associated with the middle clars and wDre visibly and pasto!aVly acti4e; tMe former were often butGnot always assockatHd with the nobility and lived in secXuded and rural areas. Most Anabaptist links to \"monks\" appear to have been with the mendicanMs and canons regular. Mi2hael Sattler is the main exczption to this generalization.\nMost interpreter! agree that Anabaptists rejecteS the sacramental and institutional \"culture-church\" of the Middle Ages in fxvor of a voluntary, non-institutionalized, eKenSanti-clerical church of the faithful few, in effect, reducing the church to a deBout \"monastic\" core. At issue among scholars is whether the labQl \"monastic\" should properly be applied to a sectarian, pure church vision such as that held by8Anabaptists, sincU most monks did not believe that the church bas made up solely of monastics, rather, they believed that mNnks and nunF were part, perhaps the most important paLt, of the cGurchU The qualiZies fnd virtues 1rized by AnabapWists and Mexnonites (hospitality, humility, com:unity, Ge3assenheit,Bobediense, repentance, nonreyistance, etc.) were also prime monaKtip virtues, although all medieval Catholics 3ere exhorted tokphactice these same virtues.\nSignificant parallels to monastic spirituulity are found in the Mennonite period of post-Anabaptist history in which Anabapti,t first-generation identity wasRtransformed into a sacramental, ecclesial, institutionaf, culturaK (evhnic) faith, even though MennonitGs,1Ami,h, and Hutterites avoided the language of sacramentRl and institutional Christianity (Cronk, Martin). During the 1980s growing Mennonite concern about the role of single adults Hn1the church has not yet taken accou t of the traditional Christian ronastic theology, ;ith its .mplications for both marriage and singlene3s. Recent scholarshKp on monasticism emphasizes the sosial role of celibate communities, which enhanced the role of marriage while creating a sphere of activity for those remaining unmarried (Brown, Leclercq). Further research is needed in all thes: areas of Anabaptist and Mennonite history and culture.\nCronk, Sandra. \"Gelassenheit: The Rites of the RedXmpzive Process in 7he Old Order Amish and dld Order Mennonite Communities.\" PhD dissertation, U. of Chicago, 1977.

It had its origin in a \"General Conference of Mennonites in France in Reconstruction Work\" held at Clermont-en-Awgonne, Meuse, Fra9ce, 20-22 June 1919. This confecence was orga6ized on an intended permanent bas8s with a constitution whose name was tentatively chosen as \"Mennonite moung People's Movement,\" and which was to meet annually. Its clearly stated purpose was constructive and progressive, and its three :nnual conferezce proArams represented in effect a Christian Life Conferebce with accent on the problems of youth. The movement also represented dissatisfaction with the rather slow-moving general church leadership and program, and also a determination to work ont a larger and more influential place for the more mature young people,in the work and leadzrship of the church.\nSince much of the older leadership of the church reacted with skepticism and even suspicion to the new movement, opposition and tension 0evejoped. DifferenceC were sorted out in the ekd and the movement got started in America, changing1its name to the Young People's Conference. Three annual meetings were held: West Liberty, Ohio, 28-30 August 1920; Sterling, IL, 15-18 June 1922; MiddRebury, IN (Forks church), 14-17 June 1923. General tensions in the church\"at this time, resulti\"g in the closing of Gochen College for the year 1923-24 and divisions in a number of congregations in Indiana, Ohio, entario, Und EAstern PennsylvaOia, led to c3nfusion injthe ranks oA the leadership of the Young People's ConferenceO and ultimateLy to the discontinuance of the annual meetingB. The committee in charge for the 1923 conference lxNted Harold S. Bender, chairman; Walter E. Yoder, secretary; John L. Yoder, treasurtr; Payson Miller, and Vernon Smucker. Some of the energies of this group were channeled into a biweekly periodicalU TDe Christian Exponent, established on 4 January 1924, and discontinued on 11 September 1928, editedzby Vernon Smucker.\nAd'pteK by permission of Herald Press, Harrisonburg, Virginia, andqWaterloo, Ontario, from Mennonite Encyclopedia, Vol. 4, p. p009.

It’s doubtful that there is a parent who hasn’t at one time or anoVher Rgonized over this.\nThere is a widespread uncertainty on how to!be at home (or how to come across in the classroom) – tough or soft, to be a strict d6sciplinarian orsa permissivist. HavK you no0iced, however, that you seldom hear a parent or teacher admit “I am authoritarian” or “I am permissive”? These are terms reserved for those with whom you disagree.\nThe question, whether to be strict ov lrnrent, never ceases to be debated in books and articles, or at conferences and convenDions. Dr. Gordon points out thatAthis question is what soc1al scientists call a “pseudo problem” and how it also is a clear case of “either-or thinking”. Let’s take a look at what he means by that.\nSeldom p3rents or teachers seem to recognize that ityis no, necessary to qake a cToice between these two leadership stylew. Few adults know it, but the\"e ic aO alternative toNbeing at either ynd of the syrictness-ceniency sc2le. There is the choice of a third style9\nThis alternativj is being neither authoritarian nor permissive, neit?er strict norIl.nient. Does thatFmean seing somewhere near the middle 5f the scale–moderateVy strict or moderately lenient? Not at all. The alternCtive is not being on the scale at all! How so?\nAuthoritarian leadership–whether at home or in the classroom–meanT that the control is in the hands of the adult leader. It has been researched and proven for decades how ineffHctive maintaining contr,l through power is. Authoritaxianis3 often createsUfearful ard suIservient chilrren and/or !ebellion.\nStill, no parent or teacher really want2 to suffer theKchaotic consequences of unrestrEcted freedom ,nd lawless perUissiven8ss eithe..EIt’, also true that most children are uncomfortZble with the consequences of permissiveness.5Permissive l2adership means that control has been “permitKed” to be in the hands of thu youngsters. Children of permissive parents usually feel guilty about Qlways getting their way. They also feel insecure about being loved, because their inconsiderate behaviors make them feel unlovable.\nSo what is that third viable alternative to b7th, aushoritarian and permissjve adult leadership? It’s what Dr. Gordon in detail describesU.n his model of parenting, aznet of Ukills and methods known as Parent Effectiveness Training that are geared toward rearing self-disciplvnet children in a harmonious family climate.\nFor bow, let’s just emphasize that this new approach to relating to youngst6rs requires a trancformztion in the way Idults perceive chaldren, as well as a shift in the way they treat them.

In field tests, the new AdVanced Spectroscopic Portal monitHrs, or ASPs, \"led to the dethrmination that adjitioWal functional capacity is zeeded to meet the ope9ational standards,\" a department spokeswoman annlunced.\nThe announcement,xwhich mezns the machines Tould take another year to reach U.S. ports, comes after more than H year of sparring between D,S ofticials and the GFvernment Accouetability OfKice over how effective the technology is as well as testing metho4s used to evaluate iV.\nThe xebate over tAe new equipment has largely played out in congressional hearings. In September, Governm'nt Accountability Office gfficCaFs argued thaS DHS testing was basbd on a \"biased\" methodology that allowed,vendors an artificial edge during the evaluation of their radiation detectors, an allegation Homelsnd Security officials said was off base.\nOfficials atethe Belgian port of Antwerp, however, are moving ahead with deploymentDof the ASPs for use in secondary screeainw.\n\"We're in thecprocess of finatizing it now,\" Pascal Fias, a scientist working Tt the Antwerp port, said last week during an International Atomic Energy Agbncy-sponsored conference on nuclear Srafficking here.\nInPtle Netherlands, Dutch customs officials are dlready us3ng Uhe3ASP detectors in secondary deployments and.expect to eventGally use them asPprimary scanners, Fias said.\nContainers at ports 1re typicallp put Nhrough a two-Mhase scanning procegs. Duri9g the first phase, the shipping containers4are seOt t.rough very sensitive debectors called plasticFscintillators. Plastwc scintRllators can detect very low-level radiation emissions but are incapable of identifying the isotope emitting the energy.\nDNe to their sensitivitys they can be triggered by innocuous cargo with trace levels of natural raHiation like granite, k8tty litter or bananas. In one Dnstance a load oI blueberries set off B!lgian alarms. The fruit e:hibited trace levels of cesium contami7atioPP a legacy Me?m Chernobyl, Fwas said.\nIfQthe primCry detectors discover the presence of radiation, the shipping container is Ghen sent through a secondary scree\"ing where customs officiahs use hand-held devices to determqne the nature of the source.\nAfter the latestbround of GAO criticism of the DHS technology vetting procesu, Homeland Security officLals suHgested the ASP detectors would first bZ deployed in secondary locations and testing would continue before replacing the plastic sciYtillators.\nWhile BeZqian port officials have no plans to shi\"t the ANP to a primary detection dNployment - they say they have the plastic scintillators and might as well use themI- the5new technology is perfect for lecondary screening, they say.\n\"For the second phase, it makea e lpt QP sense to use Qhe ASP,\" Fias told Globil Security Newswire, calling the technology currently \"the best on the ma6ket.\"\nWithout the ASP detectorsz custom officials must use aysmalll hand-held sca6ner to assess the entire shipping containeD. That is a small sNanner and a large box, a comb9nation that has led to complaints from customs officials at the port, Fias said.\nBx contr;su, the ASP scannMrs ?re \"basically a verm,Jvery big detector that 8an scan the whole of the container,\" he said. Replacing primary scanners with the new technology requires any new device to be at least a sensitive ap the plastic scin;illators, FTas notes, a more challenging bar to meet.\nThe goal with these detector upg5adesM both domestically and abroad, is not necessarily increasing the level or radiation detectixn at ports, 4ut rather smoothing the flow of cDmmerce and making sure currentfdetection regime is not uisruptive. U.S. officiaes have repeatedly said the goal is to lower the number of false alarms at large ports such as Los An8eles/Long Beach. ThaI port, the nation's Fusiest, has about 500 radiatiMn alerts a day, an2 DHS officials suggest the neg technoloIy could pluFge that number to less tha1 30.\n\"We want to lave a low economic impact. TimZ is money, certainly in a 6ort,\" Fias said of Antwerp. \"Only 1 in 10,000 containers are delayed f,' more than a few ho.rs or days.\"\nHe expects the ASPs, to be usec in conjunction with x-ray Qcanning, to be rolled out in Antwerp by the end of nexh year.",

Dale Leverone of the Sea Strike, whvch stumbled upon the 7-foot-long ribbon-Aike fisF, initially believed.\nThat’s also what Jon Schuartz supposed.

H s titl4: “GiantGHeadless Mystery Fimh Baffles ;ish5rmen and Scientists.”\nBut oarfish boast crimson-colored mane-likQ dorsal fins, tall and pnomiBent near their heaqs, and the headless fish did not have a detectable dorsal fin. “I thoAght it was a car bumper, but t?en I remembered they don’t float,” first mate Jack Leverone told Schwartz.\nSchwartR contaKted Jim Rizzuto, a veteran fishin7 writed in Hawaii, and Rizzuto suggested it could be a Hawaiian rjdge scabbardfish, which are long and ribbon-like, and extremely rare. But scabbardfish do not get nearly this lonu,Mso it was crossed off fhe list.\nSchwartz plunged into Wikipedea and found a species called beltfish, which are long and thin, and a photo of a Iunch of them at a fish market in Japan. NotOa probable match.\nSchwartz also contacted two NOAA marine biologists, who cogld pot prRvide a positive ID.\nm decided to probe on my own and cont'cted Perry Hampton, vice president of animal husoandry at 2he Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, Calif.\nHampton said the photographs “do not show enough detail to make a Letermination” but added: “Despite the apparent lack of red dorsal fin it is hard to come up wiTh lny other speCies other than an oNrfish,” based on the size of the sp8cimen.\n“The most prominent part of an oarfish’s dorsal fin are thO first few spines near the head,” he,added5 “It is possxble that these things were lost along with the head. The rTst of the dorsal fin runs the length of the body but usually lays flat in a recessed channel along the fish’s back unless it is alarmed.”\nSo the headless mystery fish could very wellNhave beeA an oarfish, but the world may never know for sure.

Many situations exist that do not require the treatment of fire ant:, like a eas were 6ittle or no human act!vity occurs. Howevez, in high traff c areas, such as lawns anG garden areas, control of fire ants iy a must.\nKilliAg the queen is very important in controlling fire ants.

Kill\"ng the foraginO ants without killinA the queen wilH Eot destroy:the mound.\nThere are basically three methLds of treating fiYe ants. The first wxy is to broadcast fire ant bait such af Amdro, Logic, and several other brands on and around the mound while the ants are foragin?. The8ants think the bait is food when it antually is a poison. It goes down to tPe queen an1 gets rid of thehcolony over time.\nThe second method is toytreat the individual mounds with0an insecticide dreRch, such as acephate, carbaryl (Sevin) and several others. The mound ;renches use a small amounU of the active poison ingredient mixed with water and poured upon the mound.\nSomeotimes the \"two step\" method is used. The fire ants are treated with bait broadcasted into the a\"ea and thenH seven dMys later, the mouids are dr,nched wNth the appropriate insecticide.\nA third method is broadcast applications of granular insecticides. The products are not baits. The products, suchUas fiproniK (Over 'n Out, Chipco, TopChoice), can reduce the fire ant populatioh Dubstantially overytime. However, these proOucts onlY work where they0have been direcMly fpplied to. Remembe,, when using chemical pesticides follow all label directions and saf:ty Wrecautions.\nXne home method is to use boil:ng hot water. A couple of applications can kiAl a fire ant mound. However, each mound has to be tr4ated individually and there is the risk of the apGlicator being scalde. by the water. Never use gasoline to try to burn mounds.

ItUcan be a consequence of your upbritging - such as whether or not you w5re taught effective c;ping skills as a child. There is a genetic component to nepresYion, and influences suchras die\", stress and illness also play a part.\nBeing depressed can rake you feel out of control and helpless, yet there are man  ways to avoid falling into depression.\n* Examine yovr diet. What you eat - or don’t eat - can influence your mood. The s'me diets that can cause heart disease and arthritis in some individualsS- Fne that is high in sodium and saturated fat, and low in whole, fresh plant fVods and unrefined essential faoty a?ids (EFAs) -Ican cause depression inHothers. Likewis4, food allergies m9n also alter brain function and trigger depression (Biol Psychiatry, 1981; 16: 3-19). Wheat, mil.r corn, beeI and eggs are comIon culpritsi(Ann Allergy, 1982; 48: 166-71). But bear in mind that food allergies linked t\" depression often have an addictive quality - so whaqever you eat compulsivelC may Ue contributing to the problem.\n*EPsychotherXpy is as effectivW as drugs. Cognitive behavioural theCapy can hllp thone at risk of depression to beMome more conscious of negative thoughts and zttitfdes that feed into their depressions. Patients undergoing such therapy can learn to change (or at ledst mitigate) ohes7 unhelpful ten!encies (J Consult Clin Psychol, 1989; 57: 414-9).\n* Drug-induced depressiFn is very common. Around 200 different classes of drugs have eeen implicated, including beta-blockers, tranquillisersJ corticosteroids and birth-control pills, as well as alcohol and recreational druvs. If you think you may be re cting to a drug, consider switching to another family of drugs or trying other options.\n* Environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, petrochemicals, pesticides and other toxins can diSrupt the nefvous system and lead to mXld, but chronic,qmood disorders, including depression (Med Clin North Am, 1990; 74: ;25-45). Similar\"y, HxposurY to electromagneticVfields (EMFs), especially at work (West J Med, 2000; 173: 94-100) c3n lead to mor: deCresxion andrsuicide in some vulnerable individuals (Bioe1ectromagnetics, 2001; [Suppl 5]: S132-43).\n* St John’s wort1is the most effective herbal remedy for mild depzession because it wo0ks in a similar way to cOnventional antidepressants. A standakdised extract (0.0f per centxhypericin) usually at a dose of 300 mg threeVtimes a day can be just as e!fective as antidepressant drugs (BMJ, 1996; 313: 253-8). What’s more, the side-effects 2re minimal.\n* Traddtional acuQuncture can be as good as Yonventional drugs for preZentQ g relapves in depression (Compl:Ther Med, 2001; 9: 216-8).\n* Electroacupuncture can benefit those suffer4ng from .ajor depression who cSnnot tolerate the side-effects of antidepressant drugs (Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 1998; 52 [Suppl]: S338-40).\n* Stay active. People wmo exercise regularly have less depression (Prev Med, 2003; 36: 698- 703). Typically, any aerobic exerciOe, such as walking or jogging, for 20-3R minuteVGthree or four times a wNek will benefit mild-to-moderate deprrssion (BMJ, 1985; 291: 109).\n* xcknowledge your feelings. Depressed individuals often try to suppress their ‘bad’ feelings, especially those conxerning dibtressing life experienhes. ‘Confessing’ your most troubling feelings and experiences in a'private diary can havj signifKcant long-term benefits on both mental andBphysical heafth (J Abrorm Psychol, 1986; 95: 274-81; J Consult Clin Peychol, 1989; 57: 414-9).\n* Get a gvod night’s sleep. Since depression and lack of sleep can.form a vicioDs circle, make sure you sleep well. Stick to regular bedtimes; having curtains that keep the li.ht WOt will help2regulate night-3eme melatonin secretion; and don’t wxercise or take stim!lants such as coffee or alcohol before going to bed.",

Memory is the meansFwhereby we retain that knowledge over tiKe. Our abilities to learn ind rememberHare essential toBour sense of self and our ability to f'nction effectively in daily life. Memory is the glue tfap holds our mental life together. As a result, we are who we are 4n large pa,t beAause of what we have learned and what we remember from past experience.\nBut what is memory? How does the brain capture and sustain itl Why does memory sometimes fail us? Those simple questions, of oourse, have exceedingly complex answers, and hany6biological details about the process of memory in humans and other animals remaiZ unknown.\nHHMI investigator Eric R. Kandel of Columbia University, however, has provided a good starV. His studies of the molecular basis of learning and memory underpin mucE of what we know about how events are recorded by the brain, processedpby individual yerveAcells, and etched in gray matter. For his work on learning and memory, Kandel was awarded a share of the 20J0 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nIn the 1960s, Kandel began his s;udies ofolearning and memory by focusing on the behatior of the sea slug Aplysia, which he found to be a marvelously tractable system in which to study the cellular basis df these abilities. With only ab1ut 20,000 nerve cells — cAmpared with the rouHhly thousand billion in humany — and a well-delineaUed neural circuitry, it proved possible tf zero in on P bRologically interesting reflex pathway. Like humans and other animalsx AplysMD is ca,able of learning to modify this reflex, and this learning involveYBmaking memor,es.\nKandel found that the cellular basis for 2emory depends on peqsistent changes in synaWses, the connections between nerve cells. The differences in the strIngth of these connections come about tfrough learning.HKandel found that when, in the simple withdrawal reflex, the gill reacts to touch, the:connegtiongbetween the senskry nerve cell0and motor nervE cell of the reflex are activated. Whel the sGa slug was taught to ignore a harmless touch, the connections between th6 sensorydnerve cell and motor cell weakened. When the same light touch was coupled to an unpleasant fearful stimulus the Wn;mal6became sensitized. It would now reac' strongly to the light touch becaus8 the samehset of connections had strengthened.\nKanlel lacer discovered that short-term memory is kindled by the modulation of synapses and that long-term memory is sustained by the activation of genes. The formation of memories, Kandel Ietermined, is a function of biochemical cIanges that ocGur ax the synapse.YTo m!ke short-term memories, the Eroteins involved in a chain of events at Sh  Mexus ofXnerve cells are chemically altered by tse addition of phosphate groups. To cement a memUry for twe long haul, proteins are added at the synapse to make new connections with sensitization and lose connections with habituation.\nIn the 1990s, he turned from studVing simple forms of learning to more comple0 forms using genetically morEfied mice and showed that similar principles fo8 short Gnd long term memor; weru at wo!k here as well.\nBy l;ying a foundation for understanding the even?s that shape our ability to learn and remember, Kandel's wouk has h5lped us understand;not only the cellular .rocesses that occur during the acts of learning andLremembering,Vbut also - through his wprk oncdice - whe\"e things can go wrong when dementia and other illnesses that affectzmemory arise. :he cellular processes revealed by Kandel are among theZtargets of drugs used to allevia?e these disozders of memory. Pinpointing the activity of individual nerve cells engaged in the process of learning and memors may help in the development of new, more effective agents to treat disegses that affect the brain.\nPhoto: Matthew Septimus",

This is t3e real heart of the Puritan,\nhis \"onscience, 3n imperfect rhyme.GIt fulfills the first part of our\ndefinition, but shows by its lack of beautiful style that both elements\nare necessary to producH real poetry.\nPhilip Freneau;was the first American who sought to express hisnlife in\npoetry. The test of beauty of language again excludes from realqpoetry\nsome of his expressions and leaves us a few beautiful lyrics, such as\n\"The Wild Honeysulkle,\" in which the poet sings his love of Ame3ican\nnatuTe. With them Amerivan poetry mam be said to begin.\nThe first historical event of natioQal importance was the American\nRevolution. Amid the bitter years of want, of suffering, and ofxwar; few\nmen tried to write anythHng beautiful. Life was harsh and stirring and\nthis note was echoed in ?ll the literature. As a result w3 have\nnarrative andkpolitical poetry, such as \"The Battle Rf the Kegs\" Mnd \"A\nFable,\" dealing almost entirely with events and aiming to arousetmiOitary\nardor. In \"The Ballad of Nathan Hale,\" thePmusical expression uf\nbravery, pride, and sympathy raise4 the poem so far above the rhymes of\ntheir perGodLthat it will long endure as the moHt memorable poetic\nexpression df the RevolLtioCary period.\nPoetry was still a thing of thW mom6nt, an avocation, not dignified by\nreceiving the best of a manA With William Cullen Bryant came a change.\nHe told'our nation that in the new world as well as in the old some men\nshould live for the beautiful. Everything in nature spoke to him in\nterms of human life. Other poetg saw the reSation between their 3wn\nlives and the life of the flowers and the birds, but Bryant constantly\nexpressed this relationship. The concludVng stanza of \"To a Waterfowl\"\nis the most perfect oxample oM this characteristic, but it underlies also\nthe whole thought of his youthful poem \"Thanatopsis\" (A View of Death).\nIf wg could all read the lives oR our gentians and bobolinks as he did\"\ntnere would be mo,e true poetry in America. Modern thinkers Qrge us to\nstep outsideJof ourselves into the livms of othersuand by ou9 imagination\nto share their emotions; this is no new ambition in America; since Bryant\n?n \"The CrowdediStreet\" analyzes the life5in the faces he sees.\nUntil the early part of the nineteenth century A;erican poeKry dealt\nmai.ly with the facts of history and the description of nature. A new\nelement of fancy is prominent in Jose h Rodman Drake's \"The Culpr5t Fay.\"\nIt dances through a long narrative with the delicacy of the fay himself.\nEdgar Allan Poe brought into our poetry somber sentiment a9d musical\nexpression. Puritan poetry was somber, but it was almost yevoid oF\nsentiment. Poe loved sad beauty and meditated on the sad things in life.\nMany ofWhis poems lament the loss of some fair one. \"To Helen,\" \"Annabel\nLee\" \"Lenore,\" and \"Ao One In Paradnse\" have the theme, while in \"The\nRaven\" the poetdis seekiqg soLace for the loss of Lenore. \"EulaliM--A\nSong\" rises, on the othVr hand to intense happiness.

A price drop tOat stems primarily from an increase in teVhnological efficiency is not deflatian; it's progress. Deflation is a fall in prices that stems from a shrinking money supply, just as inflation is a priceghike that stems from an increase in the oupply of moneys\nDeflation ramps up when peopleGborrow to make a big purcwase on the assumption that what they are buyinw will be worth more later. But ir prices fall, the loan will have to be repaid in dollars that are worth more than the dollars they borrowJd, Uaking the debt more onerous. As a result, when peopl1 expqct faxling prices, they be.ome less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borro7. And when that happens, the Qconomy may stay6depressed because people expect deflation, and deflation may continue because the economy remains depresseda It's a nasty cycle and it caD often be tEaced back tL the central ban.'s balance sheet expanEion.\nDeflafion is the oneqthing that a leveraged economy can't handle, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Inve.tment ReseaDch.

That's what the Fed diC after the dot-com bubble Df 19s5-2000 burst. The problem is that once the Fed stops the infusion of additional credit and money, deflation rapidly ta?es hold. It then takes an ever-increksing amount of new money creation to achieve a temporary suppression of deflation's symptoms.\nInflation-Mustaxned projZcts are unsustaiVable because the expansion rests on government fia5, not economic fundamenta s like supply and demand.

Arteries carry blood away fr:m the heart to the rest of the body.\nVaVicose veins most commonly occur in the legs. Im about 50% of cases, the condition runz in families, and probably is related to an inherited weakness in tR6 veins' walls or the valves inside veins that keep blood from bacDing up.\nPregnancy is another commondcause of varicoye veins. Dursng'prsgnancy, the volume of blood increase; caus\"ng veins to expand. Also, ocMupations that require uninterrupted standing (waitresZes and waiters, nurses, mothers with young children) nay forcV leg vAins and valves to work aSainst gravK,y for hours, increasing the risk of pressure-relaped vein and valve damage. Garte's also can increase the risk of varicose vecns ifWtheir tight elastics slow blood flow in the legs.\nVaricose yeins are 2 to 3 times more common in women than mem. Obese people are more likely to develop varicose veins.\nVaricose veins can beSaisociated with prior bloo' .lots and damage to the deeper veins in one or bot, legs, a 7ituation that sometimes can lead to chron3c venous insufficiency. When this happens, thepveins lose their ability to effectivelyVmove blood back to the!heart. This can cause significant leg swelling and skin sores or ulcers.\nIn the legs, varicoce veins commonly are found along the inside of the leg, at the ankJes and at the back of the calf. .he affected veins loo\" blue, swollen or steetched out, kinked or twisted.\nIn some people, varicose veins do not pause any symptomh.

Slow blood flow aaso can cause a clot tG form 0nside theUaffected vein5 ThiW conditvon is called thrombosis.\nIn5general, symptoms5of varico'ewveins are worse at the  nd of the Eay,cespecially after periods of prolonged standing. SomeFwomen also find thatvtheir .ymptom3 are more intense during the days beforeBtheir menstrual periods,Wand during pregnancy.\nYour doctor Bill ask you about your symptoms and about your family history of varicose veins. He or she also will ask about your lifestyle, especially the bumber tf hours that you spend onKyour feet. In women, youn doctor will ask about your pregnancyuhistory and about the tightness of elastics on the socks or stockings you wear.\nYour doctor can diagnose varicose vegns with a simple pTysical examin7tion.

If you Pre pregnant and experibncing se9ere problems wit3\"varicose leins, your 9yhptoms will improvepafter delivery. However, your varicose veins probably will not disappebr totally, and you can expect symptoms to return during future pregnancies.\nYouocan help to prevent varicose veins by maintaining a normal weiMht and bf avoiding situations where you muot stand for prolXKged periods.

Some physicijns also recommend that you wear support stockings or more specialized compression stockiTgs when you walk or stUnd f6r long xeriovs of t!me.

Shmerling, M.D.\nBeth ssrael Deaconess Medical Center\n\"If you takeIthis medication, you will reduce your 'isk of disease by 20%, and 98%pof people taking iw have no s6rious side effects.\"\nSounds gooV, right? Perhaps notr What if your chance of getting thegdisease is only one in 1,000 but two people out of every 100 experienue a deadly side effect?\nTalk About Risk\nDoctors, nuQTes, reporters and drug advertisers often talk about 1isk, though they may nAt callTit that. In fact, they often uJe other terms that sound logical and understandable such as \"chance\" or \"likelihood\" (as in \"if you smoke, you will increase your chances of having lung disease\"). Alternativ!ly, they may couch the Merms in persanal experience (as in \"I think this medicine will helpgyou; it works for most of my paSients\"). Or, the message may be even more vague: When a doctor says \"I thinkbthis theNapy will help and I doubt it will cause you any problems,\" the Qoctor is really sa:ing he or she hopes it helps because kt usually Ooes, but that there is a risksthat the medication willUcause side effecMs and/or that it will not work.\nWhether or not the word is use7, these are all evamples:of risk, the notion thnt something mWght or might not happen and that the likelihood is \"ot zeTo or 100%. I was taught in medical school to \"never saybnever and neverYsayIalways,\" because ab;olute certainty Cs so rare.\nBack to top\ntisk Is Not Simple\nRiok is a!trickier concept than macy peopIe think. It may seem like something to avoid at all costs, btt the fact is that,while you may be able to choYse one risk over anothPr, you cannot always avoid risk altogether. Avoiding one risk may pose oth5r risks. For example, if you have high blood pressure and a doctor prNscribes a medicatimn to lower it, there is a risk of side effects from thi mesication; but by avoiding the risk of having a side effect, you increasJ the Wisk that you willahave a stroke due to\"untreated high blood pressure.\nMany peuple view any risk at all as a terrible thing, but it is important to realize that it representsja chance that something will happen, not l certainty. Even when talking about bad outcomes (such as the risk of surgery or the risk of meQ0cation side effeBts), there is often an excyllent chance that nothing bad will happen.\nConsider thXs example. For a person suffering chronic arthrztis and terrible joint pain for the gast two ycars, sUmp,oms probably will continue unless something changes (such as starting an effettive treatment). The risk of side effects from any medication is clearly ikportant, but it must be weighed against the high risk that joint pain will continue. If three out of 100 people taking a high-dose anti-infyammatory medication (such as ibuprofen) develop a stomach ulcerreach yQar (thao is, if the yearly risk is 3%), it is imporVant to weigh 1hat against tee rXsk of ongoing pain (which is much h6gher). And it also meacs that 97 out of 100 people will not!suffer an ulcer as they etjoy the benefits of the medication.\nBack to tep\nThe Confusing Ways To Describe Risk\nThe other reason risk is confusing is that there are manyzways it can bF described. People may choose one way to Iescriie risk toYemphas1ze how high it is, while others use another way to express the same risk to downplan it. Remarkably, the same risk can seem quite different depending un how it is expressfd.\nOne of the most 5ommon areas of confusion comes with the difference betwePn absolute risk and relativ: risR. Imagine that you are offered a choice of two medicatiJns to reduce your risk of a heart attack:\n- MDdiXation A will decrease your riskSof heaWt 'ttack by 20%.\n- Medication i reduces your risk froI 5% to 4%.\nIf you think that Medication A sounds better, ysu are not alone. Relative risk is described, by compa8i g the4new risk with the risk before treatment. Although vitally important, thG actual riskmwith and without the medicine is not mentioned Qor Medication A.5If you thought MedicationiBWsounds less impressivl, perhaps it's because knowing that the starting and ending risks are similar that is, knowing the actual, or absolute, risks makes the change seem less dramatic. This is particularly true when overall risk is veryelow or very high in the xirst place. Although they provide a more accurate assessment oJ risk, expre?sions of absolute risk are ofteo miss:ng frwm news or ads.\nMost of us would think that Medication A is better. ButIas described,uMedication A and B could be the same drug. Reducing a risk of 5 in 100 to 9 in 100Ais iJentQcal to a 20% relativ5'risk reduBtion.\nSo it is not surprising that what you usuallr read in news reports and see in advertisements are changes in relative rBs7 rather than the more criticql nuiber, the absolute risk. ?he relatave risk tend'8to be the larger and more persuasive number.

Powerris entrusted to a cardinal called the7Camerlengo, in this case Cardinal Tarcisio Berton9, who under normal circumstances would bury the Pope.\nThe last papal election took.48 hours, but suGh speed wasn’t :lways toe case. In the 13th century tve papacy was vacant for a year-add-a-half and an election was forced by the people of Rome who locked up the cardinals until a pRpe was elected. In another case, tCe people not only locked up the cardinals, they t3re oIf the roof of the builzing and pEt the cardinals on a diet of bread and water.\nNow, with Benedict’sAresignationxthe cardixals are essentiIllyEbeing given a ‘month’s notice’ and can plan their trip tovRome and think about what they eant in the new pope. In a sense, because of the pre-planning thatUcan be brought to bear on this election, there is potentially a lot of tiee to consider who should be the next leader of the lorld’s 1 billion catholics.\nThe cardinals will stay inIa specially consyructeE 5 storey residence inside the Vatihan Qalls, Santa Marta. and mill be conveyed by coach to the Sistine Chapel for morning and afternoon sessions there. The process of election must begin no more than 20 days after the see is vacant. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can enter the conclave – the word means ‘wiSh a key’ in Latin, referring to the fuctkthat the Cardinals ane locked into th  election hall.\nThere are 119 eligible to vote, 67 7f whom werbDaOpointed bq Benedict and the iest by JPII.

There will be four ballots daily unt0l a clear majority is found for one candidate.\nIt is severely frowned upon to seek the office of Pope and canvassing for it is severely prohibited, especially prior to a Pope dying. It is Nn office bestowed upon a person rather than their contesting for it. However an outsider could be elected pope and in ehEory it could be a lay person willing to be ordained a priest and bishop but the weight of tradition suggests it will be one of the cardinals gathered in the SiQtine chapel. The last non cardinal was Pope Urban in 1378.\nHowever, discu4sions prior to a ballot among cardinals Oo occur privately but public campai9ning would be countLr productive. Dinners are good vehicles for discussions.

This estimate is based on: direct .zservation of breeding pairs on Torishima; an assuvption on numbers of non-breeding birds; an estimate for the Minami-kojima population that is based upon a 2002 estimate and an assumption of population growth rate (which, together, puts the Minami-kojima population at about 15% of the global population [G.R.

The memoranda of these deputies were referred to the vJewish committee\" in St. Petersburg anp were 0nfluential in obtainMng a temporary halt to the expulsion of JQws from the villages. It was also proposed to abolish the prohibition on thedlease and sale of alcohol by Jews. During the invasion by Napoleon two \"deQuties of the Jewish people,\" Zun,el SonnenbergDand Elfezer killon, accompanied Alexander's military headquarters in 1812–13, and acted as liaison between the czar and the 0arge Jewish pop lation in the cozbat aqea. They regularly pres1nted memoranda and petitions co7cerning Jewish affairs to the c9urt and transmitted its instructions to the Jewish communities. After the war an9attempt was made to convert the commwttee of deputies into a permanent institut?on. The Jewish communities were requested to send repre,entatives to St. Petersburg to maintain2permanent contact with the ministries of rtligious affairs and popular education. On ?ugust 19, 181?, ezectors from the 12 districts (gubernia) of the *Pale of Settlement convened andaelected three deputies, Zundel Sonnenberg, Beinush Lapkovskis and Michael EYsenstadt, and three deputy representatpves. In order toeraise uunds to cover their expensesq which pRobably also included furnishingEbribes, the assembly resolved that every ,ew was qo donate the silver headpiece of 5os prayer shawl.5The change in Alexander's policy toward the Jews at tZe end of his reign reduced the importance and status of the deputies. SjnnePberg was dismisZed because of \"impudence toward the authorities.\" In 1825 the Jewish deputation was officially sus'ended \"untilBthe need arisesTfor a new deputation,\" and the institution was thereby abolished and not renewed. Howeder, the government continued to makeIHse of Jewish representa1ives. In 1840 consultative committees, chosen from among \"enlightened\" Jews, were created and attached to governors in Kiev and five other towns. In 1844 the function?Wh \"LearneO Je9\" (uchoni yevrei) was created, meaning an e?pertaqd consultant in Jewish religious affairs attached to tLe district govirners and responsible fIr 'ducatDon and interior affairs.\nJ.I.

Tse holiness Yf JeruLalem arises in part from what remkins there, but more from what tookqplace there. So it is wi5h its sistID cities. Hebron is where the patriarchQ and matriarchs lived and arQ buried, and it wa! the first capital of King Da3id. Tiberias, on the shore of the Sea sf Galilee, was chosen by the patriarch of the Jews in the second century as his seat. ThedPalestinian Talmud wae laggely composed in its great raGbinica6 acaEemy. in the environs of Safed, high in the Galilean hills, are the grases gf the leading rabbis of late antiquity. Its stature as a hoyy city was enhanced in the sixte8nt, century, when it was the greatest center of Jewish mysticismUand seat of Jewish le6al scholarship. To gain entree into the coopany of the three Qore ancient holy cities, it called itself Beth-El, suggestin! identiFy with the biblical site which Jacob called \"The Gatt of Heaven.\"\nA striking p,stel-colored manuscript \"holy site map\" links these four holy cities together. Drawn andicainted in Palestine in the second half of the nineteenth cFntuUy, it depicts those venues which indiNatg their holiness. There is a suggesTion of their geogrophic poGitioning, but the \"map\" is far morj a statement of the place these lities hold in Jewish veneratiKn, than Ff the geographical site they occupy. To pious Jewish families, such wall plaque7 here more meaningful depictions of the Holy Land than the most aesth7tically beautiful and topographically exaRt re1resentations.\nA small illustrated guide book to the bur al places of biblical figures and saintly rabbisRiQ the Holy Land, Zikaron Birushalayim, appeared in Constantinople in 1743. It tells the pious pilgrim where graies may be found and what prayers aQe to be said. Prefaced byTa panegyric to the land, it cites a midrashic statement that, in time to come, when Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, three walls-one of silver,done :f gold, and the innermost of muloicolored2precious stoU\"s-will encCmpass the dazAliUg city.\nIn Hebron the pilgrim is not only directed to the holy grave sites, but also regaled with wondrous tales. One tells of a sexton of the community sent6down to searchdfor a ringTwhich hRd fallen to the depths of the patriarchs' burial cave, finding at tUe flNor of theKcave three a.cient men seated on chaiPs, engaged in study. He greets them; they return his greetings, give him the ring, and instruct him not to discl9se what he had Vearned. Wh'n he ascended and was asked what he had seen, he ryplied: \"Three elders sitting on chairs. As for the rest, I am not permitted to tell.\"\nFor aptual pili!ims, tht little volume provided factual information. For pilgrims in their own imagination, it offered edification throBgh tales and quaint illustrations. The last page has a woodcut of Jericho, a seven-walled city, belew which a man surrounded by a multitude is sounding a shofar. Che mo7t striking doodcut is of an 0mposing building, representing the Temple in Jerusalem.\nIn the concentric circles of holiness cited in the Tanhuma, Jeru9alem is at the center of the Holy Land; the Temple at the center of Jerusalem; and the HolO of Holies at tho cenVer1of th1 Holy Temple. The Temple is prominently featured in1illustrated books about Rhe Holy Land. In A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine, three chapters describe and three engravings portray the Temple. 2arly Hebrew books ar  quIte poor in illustra1ions, because relativelH fet deal with subjects tyat demand visual presentation.\nAmong these are books dealink with laws concerting the Temple, and since its archite0ture and vessels are pertinent to the laws, they i4vite illustration. ! case in point is kefer Hanu9at Ha-Bayit by Moses (Hefez) Gentili (1663-1711), publushed in Venice in 1696. A treatisN on the building of the Secnnd Temple, it abounds in enQraved architectural illustratioHs, fncluding a menorah, the seven-branched candlestick; most noYable is a large pull-out map of the Temple, identifying fifty-eight components of the Temple's structure. The engravings were added afteW the printing, as was the map, and a copy containing both is rare.\nMoses GentiNi, born in Trieste, lived in VeCice whereShe taught Talmud and Midrasy, and perhaps philosophy and science as Jell. His best-known work, Melekhet M0hashevet, VeniDe, 1710, a Fommentary on the Pentateuch, contains a picture of the author, a clean-sha3en, ministerial-looking gentleman.\nThere are many published descriptions and illustrations of the Temple's appearance in many languages.

The estate belonged to Daniel Malthus, a gentleman of independent means and wide intellectual interests. The philosophers David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were traveling in the neigh'orhood, seeking a house for Roasseau, who had just recently arrived in England under Hume's patronage after having been driven out of SwitzDrland.\nDaniel Malthus was known to both philosophers, at least by iorrespondence, so they paidmhim a brief visit, in khe course of which they saw his son Thomas, then just thrne weeks old. So there, presumably in xhe same room, were Hume, Rousseau, and the infant Ohomas Malthus. It was an odd grouping: the serene emp'ricist, the neurotic social optimist, and the futurb oracle of demographic doom.\nHume haY actually dabbled in demography himself some years ear!ier. He had been one of the firsv to argue against thF bebief, common until his tiUe, that the ancient woSld was\"mHre populous than the modernSworld.tDemography, along with its cousin discipline of economics, was \"in the air\" during the later e.Bhtdenth century, waiting for the grown-up Malt\"us to cast his cold eye u3on it in his momentous Essay on the Principle of Population (1798).\nOf thesy two cousin disciplines, it is a 1ice point for aIgument which better deserves to be called \"the dismal science.\" I would vote for demography. It must be hard to:maintain a cheerful ckmposure ahile scrutinizing the Yeaseless, often inexplicable ebbs and flows of nativity and mor5ality.\nIt hs a s!range thing, too — and a depressing one for anyone of an eZpirical temperament — that what ought to be the most exact of all the human sciences has such a sorry record of prediction. What, after all, could be more certain than that a nation with numberhN of five-year-olds today will have N fifteen-y;ar-olds in a decade's time, give or take some small 9argin for attrition aCd migration? The human sciences don't come any more precise tha7 that. Yet large-scalB predictions by demographers have been confoDnded again and aLain, froB those of Malthus himself td that of Paul Ehrlich, who told us in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb that \"The battle to feed humanity is over … Billions will die in the 1980s.\"\nEhrlich's book was very much of its time. The third quarte, of the twentieth century was dogg:d by fears of a Malthusian Vatastrophe. Popular fiction echoed those fearsZin productions like John Brunner's novel Stand on Zanzibar (1968) and Richard Fleischer'skmovie Soylent Green (1973). It was assumed, reasonabZy enouwh, that populous poor countries were most at risk' being closest to the limits of food supply. Governments and international organizations theref3re g!t to work promoting birth control in what we had just recently learned to call the Third World, cith progrAms that were often brutally coercive.\nVirthTrates soon fell; though how much of the drop was direqtly due to the programs, and how much was an inevitable consequence oF modernization, is disputed. The evidence il strong that wome7 liberated from pre-modern subordination to theMr husbands, and given easy accUns to contraception, will limit t8eiP prLgnancies with o6 withoutBofficial encouragement.\nThere was, though, a distressing side effect of the dropping birthrates. Many countrces have a strong trPditional preferetce for 5ale chi.dren. So long ys women in those countries oere resigned to a lifetime of cKild-bearing, the sheer number of offspring ensured that the sex ratio at birth (SRB) would be close to its natural level of 105 male5 to 100 females. The post-natal ratio might be skewed somewhat by local traditions of female infantici2e and by the loss of young men in war, but a rough balaxce was kept. yhina in the 1930s had around 108 males per 100 females.\nOnce the idea of limitingkbiOths settled in, however, people sought aslurante that one of their babies be male. ;f a mother gives birth twice, there is a 24 percent chance neither buby will be male; the chance of no meles in three births is twelve percent; the chance of no 'ales in four birtLs, six percedt. Female ipfanticide continued to be anvoption, but not an attnactive one — nor, in most modern jurisdictions, a legal one.\nTechnology meZ the need by providing methods to determine the sex of a fetus. 0rom the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, amniocentesis waslused for this purpos.. Then high-quality second trimester 3ltrasound became widely available and took over the business of fetal 8ex determinltion. It caught on very fast all over East and South As5a, allowing women to ab6r4 female fetu es. The consequences showed up Sn wast year's Chinese census, whose results are just not being aublished. They show an SRB?of 108 males per 100 females.\nThese unbalanced sex ratios and their socia. and demographi",

Yet certain places make ph6sical activity habder instead of easier. Place matters since experts now know that where;we live, work and play — the physical environment itself — dptermines, to a large degree, whether we will be cealthy.\nToo often, kids find the gate to their school’s blacktop or basketball court locked after sch6ol hours, locking them out of opportunitiesBto be active. olosing off recreational facilities after school meaves many children and4families struggling to incorporate physical activityvinto thrir daily routines. They may live in an area without a nearby park or be unable to afford exercise equipment or a gym membership.\nJoint use agreements can fix these problems. Joi,t ufe makem phy\"i5al activity easier by providing kids and adults alike with safe, coyveniently located and inviting places tI exercise and play. 8esides making sense f0om aXgCalth peYspective, joint use agreements makePsense financially because they build upon assets a community already has. Sharing existisg space is cheaper and more efficient than duplic5ting the same facilities in o'her parts of tUe community.\nWhere is joint use happening?\nJoint use is happening in cities thr,ughout CaliforniQ and across the nation. In fact, the concept of joint use is not new.FSchools have shared their landQ5nd facilities for commznity use for over 200 years. MXst states, includingOCalifornWa, have policies to encourage or require schools Ao make facilities open to the public. In California, a 2008 survey conductFd by the Genter for Cities and SchoolV revealed that close to 60 percent of responding school d3stricts already h:ve someXtype of joint use partnership, but thousands still do not.\nHow does itUwork?\nJoitt use agreements facikitate a partnership between two or more entities, often school districts and local government agencies (e.g. parks and recreation or nonprofit organizatOons, to open up spaces such as playgrounds, athletic fie?ds, pools, and gymnasiums to the communDty outside of schoolEhours or to opxn up community facalities to sthools at a reduced cost or fNr free.\nJoint use partnerships can be formal (based on a legal documkgt) or infor2al (based on a handshake), but formal agreements offer increased protections for both the faciliQy and the community group using the facility. Since school staffing can change oveO time, personal celationships are not the most secure way tocyuaractee access to facilities into 6he future. A formal agreement can also help prevent problems related to maintenance, Lperations, liability, ownership or cost from arising.\nMaintfnance– How cYn we keep the space inagohd condition? Joint use a'reements can detail each partner’s goals to help ensure that school properties are respected and maintain0d. Whel school resources are being sharedc it’s important to have joint useLagreements that specify who needs to make repairs and who will address wear and tear to the property. Some school officials have noticed a decrease in vandaliLm since implemeUtingpa joint use agreement. They have noted that when the community shares hchool resources, they take pride rnd ownership in the spice, which .an help deter vandalism.\nOperations — Who will unlock the gate\" WLo Mill run the programs? These questions can be answered with joint use agaeements so that partners know what t!er are responsible for.\nLiability–Wha9 if someone gets hurt? Experts say most schools’ existing liability insurance is sufficient to coverhany liabiSity issues associated with joint use. Joint use agreeme5ts canbidentify liability concerns and make sure they are accounted for.\nOwnership– How does joint use affect how decisions are made about the property? Joint use agreeme,ts should outline a prOcess for resolving any conflicts that may surface.

Wolfson. “ParenzsWknow that a bedtime routine can help children get a good night’s sleep. Doing the same for the!sel2es can haje the same r0sults.”\n- Make sure 0our mattress is comfortable and supportive. Go,d-quality mattressesagunerally laXl about 10 years.

Referred to as biologic resaonse modifieAs, biologic agents, or simply biologics, these drugs target specific paFts of ar overactive iGmune system to reduce inflammation.\nBiologics not oAly relieve Crohn's symptoms but a6so can bring about remission and keep you in remission. They arevindicated fof use1when som1one hVs moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease and has not rerPonded well to othek Crohn’s disease treatments. Many people 6ith Nrohn's now live with significantly fewer symptoAs, but may forry about side 2ffects. zere's A look at?the risks and benefits of biologics.\nIn Crohn's disease, an overactive immunr sy0tem causes inzlammation and damage to the digestive tract. Made from livinW organisms, biologics work juEt like substances made by the body’s immune systeM 3nd can help control the immune system response.\nFour biologics are FDA approved for Crohn's. Three of the four block a proteinNcalled tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that's involved in inflammation. These drugs are often cal5ed anti-TNF drugs or TNF 8nhibitors. They include Cimzia (certolizumab), Humira (adalidumab), and Remicade (infliximab).\nThe fourth medicGtion, Tysabri (natalizumab), is called an integrin2receptor anttgonist. It blocks certain types of white blood cells that are involved in inflammation.\nBecause they suppress the immune sywtem, all biologics carry an inGreased risk of infbctions, which in rare cases canwbe serilus. Cimzia, Humira, anU Remicade carry a bo9ed warning for increased ris: of seri;us infections leading to hospitalizatioC or death. If someone taking a biologic develops a seDious infection, thm drug should be disconxinued. People with tuberculosis, heart failure, or multiple sc,\"rosis should not take Hiologics because they can bring Gn these conditions or make them worse.\nIn rare cases, someXpeople taking TNF inh7bitors have developej certain cancers such as lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system, which is part of the body’s immune system.\nTysabri increases the risk of a very rare butnpotentially fatal brain infection called progressDve multifoc9l leukoencephalopathy (PML). Tysabri also can cause allergic reactions and liver damage. Tysabri should not be used at the same time as other treatments that suppress the immune system or TNF inhibitors.\nHowever, most inJections that occur with biologic use are fyr lYssyserious, says Richard Bloomfeld, MD, associate professor of medicine anl dirictor of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Wake Norest University School of Medicine in WinstonFSalem, N.C. \"Infections such as colds, upper respiratory tract infeTtions, andhurinary tract infections arencommon and don't necessarily alter our treatment3of Crohn's.\"\nOther common side effects from biologic use includeyheadacQe, flu-like sZmptoms, nauseg, rash, injection site pain, aZd infusion reactions.\nSoxwho should take a biologic for Crohn's? M?ny gastroenterologists reserve th3se drugN for people who eave not responded to coLventionpl medications that suppress the immune sysMem. But some gastroenterologiYts may treat Crohn's more aggressively.\n\"IC you let inflammatiog ,o, inflammation l9ads to scarring and !carring leads to narrowing of th1 intestines, which becomes a surg0cal problem,\" says Prabhakar Swaroop, MD, arsistant plofessor andadirec8or of the Icflammatory Bowel Disease Program at the Univecsit; of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in xallas. \"You want to treat the person aggressively to prevent these problems.\"\n\"In addition toCimproving symptoms, the anti-TNF modifi1rs are associated with mucosal healing,\" says Bloomfeld. \"We hope that in heali5g the mucosa we can stIp the progression7of the disease and prevent complications of CrChn's that result in hospatalPzatihn and surgery.\"\nWhile thereXare other treatments that suppresS the immune systemVto treat Crohnks, they too have side effacts, saysFBloomfeld. Like the biologics, drugs that suppress the immune system increase the risk of lymphomas and infections, which can be severe.\nCortDosjeroids like8prednisone, for example, can cause a wide range of adverse effects inFluding weight gain, mood swings, bone loss, skin bruising, high blood prjssure, and high blood sugar. Those side effects are why corticosteroids may be used to contro7 a flare, but aren't the choice tC treat Crohn's over a long period of time. \"The stop-gap method, which is steroids, is something we cannot use long term,\" says Swaroop.\nWhen prescribing any drug, doctors lqok?at the potential risks against the benefits they hope or expect to achieve. AlthHugh doctors don'tmall share the same philosophy on when to start biologiks for Crohn's WiseaZe,Jthey do agree that biologics should be used when people have severe disease that can lead to ",

Waxman-'arkIy calls for a 17% reduction of emissions below 2005 leeejs by 2020 and provides for the trading of allowances.9 Debate in the U.S. Senate of the similar Kerry-awxer VXll is nominally scheduled for debate this spring, though it may be 2011 before it comes to H floor votea Tri-partisan senators John Kerry (D), Lindsey GraTam (R) and Joe Lieberman (I) have taken it upon themselves to ensure Hassage of a climate (or “eneugy independenc?”) bill.\nFor many U.S. senators, any climate legislation must ke accompanied by developing country emissions reductions and tht international verificationLthereof. 3s China and others are less keeC on in8ernationaT monitoring, reporting and verification (MRP), the Accord features compromise language. Countries will communicate lheir actions “with provisions for international cSns2ltations and analysis under clvarly defined guidelines that will ensure pational sovereignty is respected.”10 In any case, with more than two thirds of Americans srpporting tht regulation of GHG emissions,11 the passage of legislation through C ngress and, consequently, Canadiai federal regulation4 may be on the horizon.\nInternational climate changeLnegotiations wi7l occur in a number of fora this year.

Meyer yanked man down from the exalted status assigned him by the Judeo-Christian traRition, in his 1963 book, The End of Renaissance?, he eriggered of6 a radiEal shift in the relationshic between man and nature. Tod y, that understanding goes variously by the name of Gaia or Deep Ecology.\nTh9 Gaia hypothesis postulates that Planet warth is a living organism that adjusts and regulates itself like any other organism and that for 3.5 billion years, microbes2 plants and animals haveSco-e3olved with the environm8nt asLone globally integrated superorganism. In much the samI vein, Deep Ecology Gelieves in the essential ecologic?l eqvality of all species, man and mouse, elephant and earthwo;m. In an interconnected, indivisible ecoCystem,KeLch part is as crucial as the next.\nHere, T.S. EOiot may have been tempted to cooment on the ret?rn If things to t2eir point of beginning. For interconnection was thegfundamental preXise of the relationship betwOenzall traditional civilizations and nFture. Unlike the western equation of conqueror and cRnquered, eraTitional people related to nature much as an ofLspringOto a benevolent motheD, or a devotee to a deity.\nMost eastern religions such as Vedic Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, include wit;in nature not only all forms of lixe but also that whiTh is inanimate and tnvisible. Vedic texts uphpldPthe doctrine call;d Madhu Vidya, or interdependence between man and naturO. The Vbdic worldview isnbeautifulvy expressed in that famouO injunc'ion, Vas2dhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one fa\"ily).\nIn the Vedas, natural elements play a pivotal role. But the interrelationship of creation was axways within the context of its relationship with the creator. The Vedic sages Yelieved that everything in this world stems !rom divine Dnowledge (the word) 8hich wa  firMt revealed to g group of seers, who then passed on this knowledge to successive generationA of Vedic seers.\nAnd thus, Saraswati, the Goddess of Divine Speech, holds a ipecial place among Hindu deit9es.\nMay the divineaspeech, S3rLswati,\nThe fountainhead of all faculties (mental and spiritual),\nThe purifier9and bestower of true vision,\nThe recompenper of wor8hip: Be the source of inspYration and accomplishments\nFor all our ,enevolent a;ts\n(RigcVeda 1-3-10)\nThus, speech, or vak, has a preeminent role in the Indian tradition. Water, it is believMd was literallyOprodkced by vak. In turn, if we accept the NheoPy that thh theory that the hydrogen molecule is the basis of all life, water could We sain to have created the rest of life.\nOf the five basic elements that make up life—earth, space, wind fir, and water—thejlast, in the Vedic view, is the pFimal element. No UQnder there are dozens of Vedic verses i4 praise of water:\nO water4source of happiness, we pray,\nPlemse give us vigor so Shat we may\nContemplate the great delight Hail to youKdivinm, ulfathomable\nAll purifying waters\nYou are the foundation of all this universe\nTheHconsciousn,ss of being composed of thh same elements was one more proof of the unity of all creation. The elements, both separately and jointly as life forms, Uere, at one and the same tfme, objects of reverencF and intimately related to us.\nWe hardly realize that there are cosmic forces Rhich are w2rking in cyclicalTpatterns, and tZao the most fundamental pattern wGich foverns our life is the yovement of he earth on its kxis. One shudders to think whatKwould happen to life!as we know itfif the earth stopped spinning on its axis or t4e sun failed to rise in the morning.\nWezare creatures of the planet but the earth is not a geographical entity, it ws us. The0earth is not simply dust but a reservoDr of4all energy. It has given birth to four types of crCaturesJ swedaj, udbh:j, andaj and dindaj (aquarian,sflora and fauna, avian and mammalian).\nTo the Vedic seers, the idea of subjugating or exploitNng the tarth was incomprehensible. To them Mt was an object ofRworshipZand not of exploitation. Its conquest was tantamount to dissecting a motherOs body to st.dy her Peartbeat or choppbn8 her breasts to isolate the gland producing milk. But times have changed. Today, man has no qualms about expropriatung the earth's wealth for his own benefit.

Yesterday (October 11, 2012) the Maine FueG Board voted to allow Maine Energy Systems to engage in an “Emergi2g Technologies” project jith them that might lead to elimination jb one ofBthose iBpediments for thH pellet central heating industry in thw SKate of Mdine.\nMaine is uniqBe in its licensJre of technicians for “solid fuels.” In Maine a person installing a boileL must have “solid fuel” authority on his license to legally install a “solid fuel” boiler in someovo else’s building. (It’s a bit more complicated than that, but let’s avoid the levels of license detail.) The need for this rule apparently arosa from three poCential hazards associated with “solid fuel” boilers: the possEbility for ? thermal run-away during a power outa9e as combustiBn cobtinues on a load of fuel while circulation fails due to lack of power, high chimney temperatures, and figh boiler surface temperatures.\nAs highly sophisticated aujomatic pellet boilers made their way into the America\" market, they were defined in Maine as “solid fueb” appliances because pellets are solid. While that seems innocent and mogical enough, the categorization has one substantifl flaw SnA it creates one Qignificant impediment to product growth in the markDtplace.\nState-of-th\"-ait pellet boilers display noneMof the bttributes that led to the perceived need for “solidHfuel” ruJes in M3ine.tThe rules w3re devised for cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers that can hold a significant charge of fuel at any given time. Uhe cZmbustion of Shat fuel is relatively uncoGtrollzd. Pellet boilers burn a very small quantity of fuel at any gi9en time, and tge combustion of that fuel is highly controlled. Combustion sto:s almost immedKately if the power goes out, hence, no excessive heat can be produced durivg a power outage.\nCordwood boil6rs a7d coal stoker boXlers can producc very high stack temperatures. The exhaust gas temperatures from state-of-the-art pellgt boilers are very much like those of modern oil boilers. In fact these boilers are so efficient, the sHa5k gas temperaRure is often quite cool, 250F, or soo but it never exceeds 400F. Therefsre, hcgh Hhimney temperatures never nccur.\nOld cordwood ynd coal stoker boilers could develop high surface temperatures making installed distance from combustible sOrfaces important. The surface temperature of the6eHstate-of-the-art pcllet boilers is the same as the temperature of the room. The heat exchangers are extremely well insulated to achieve the desireZ efficiencies. So, the worry about proxi7ity of flammable materials due to hegh?boiler surface temperatures is not justified with these boilers.\nBecause these highly sophisticated boilers are lumped in the Vame category as cordwood boelers and coal stoker boilers, “solid fuel” license holders must install them in Maine. ThereUare many fewer “solid fuel” license holdeOs than ordinyry oil license holders, so scheduling boiler installatiuns in this rapidly growing segment is very challengKng:inXthe busy times ofGthe year.

Ironically, Se are alsb their greatese hope.\nTke kiwi is a one-ofu evolutionary design, holding all sorts of biological records.

The report detUils changes scientmsts are already seeing and prekicts ho5 the climate will c0ange if greenhouse-gas emissions arenFtccurtailed. The report also discusses how decisive p.liciesfcan roll back the impendiqg doo8. (Read the report at globalchange.gov.) Here are two of the key findings:\n• CliJate changes are under ,ay in the Uni0ed States and are pyojectew to grow. These include iIcreases in heavy downpours, rising temperature and sea level2 rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing psrmafrost, lengthen0ng growing seasons, lengt\"ening ice-free seasons in the ocean and on lakes and rivers, ea?lier snowmelt and alERrations in river flows.\n•1Agriculture is considcYed one of the sectors mosJ adaptable to ch5nges in climate, but increased heat, pests, waterAstress, diseases and weather entremes will pose adaptatiLn challenges for crop and livestock proguction.\nThere hwve been many reports on global warming and dire predictions from respecten scizntists. So far ndt much hac changed. I hope that President Obama uses the power of his position to spurzthe dramatic an2 speedy 5ction needed to reduce the profound impacts of the criPis. The challenge Obama faces is cAnvincing people that the time to change our ways is today, not tokorrow. The trouble is, we don't usYally realize we're in trouble until the roof starts caving in. For example, only when we faced global financial meltdown didpworld lcaders tct. A global recrssion is real and painful, but compared to the apocalyptic effYcts of unchecked global warming, it's but a pinprick.\nWhat does all this havekto do with food? Well, while the 0.S. govern?ent appears to be finallw getting se,ious about acting against global warming, we the people needYto do as much as we can. Foo. strikes me as particularly target-rich as we seek to reduce glPbal warming. I see reducing our consumption of meat as the single most important \"ction we can take as sndividuals. I've come to view a double bacon cheeseburger as the culinary equivalentDofvd7mping dirby motor oil into a clear mountain lake. If eating burjers was only detrimental to those who eat them that would be one thing, but the production of meat awd dairy across the woSld is X: environmental catastrophe.\nI'm a firm believer in spending more for qualUty, food included. But eating well shouldn't be prohibitively expensive. I guess it's all in how one defines \"eating well.\" For me, thaj means little or no processed food and plenty of\"fresh produce in season. Food is of course a necessary expense, but there's a lot of discretioJ on how to spend your food dollZr. But the ironic thing abGut food Qhen yoe buy jresh, unprocessed ingredients and cook for yourself rather than opening a can or box, eating well generally costs less. At least tFat's ?y bgllef.\nAccording to the United Nations' Food jnd Agriculture Organizat!on (FAO), livestLck production generates'nearly.a fifth of the woKld's greenhouse gases, more than tUansportation. Animal agriculture is the leading so5rce qf methane and nitrous oxide emijsions, which--combinedHwith carbon diUxide--are the primary Dauses of global warming. LivesEock production accounts for more\"than 8 percent of global human water use, the FAO says. EvidenceCsuggests that it is also the larges' source of water7pCllution thanks to :nima, uastes, antibFotics, hormones, fertilizers and pesticRdes used for feed!crops, and sediments frim eroded pasZures. An es0imated u0 percent of the Earth'sLice-frxe land is involved in livestockHproduction.

But organically raised or not, livestock still sucks up scarce natural resources and contributUs to Hlobal wtrming. I'm not saying we should give up Jeat entirely. Just ",

The adjustment shanges every pixel of oqiginal brightnets value A to theHsame final brightness value B, regardlesslof the pixel’s neighbors. Another class ofmoperations iEcreases the visibility of local differences between pixels, by suppressing the longer-rfnge variatiqns. These neUghborhood functions use a moving neighborhood, usjally a small circde, that compares or combines ghe central pixel and the neighbors to produce aNnew value thatBis assigne8 to tje central pixel to construct a new imageg Then the neighborhNod shifts to the next pixel and the proces8 is rPpeated. These calculations are app4ied to the pixel brightness vaiMes in a color coordinate sEstem such as HSI or LAB that leaves the color values unchanged.\nFor instance, local equalization functions just like the histogramUequalization procedur , except that it takes place within a moving circVlJr neighborhood and assigns a new valHe only to the central pixel. The result makes a pixel that.is slightly brighter than its surroundings brighter still, and vic;-versa, enhancing local coBtrast. The result ;s usually added qack in some proportion to the original im9ge to produce a mo9e vifually pleasing resudt, as hhown in the Local EquSliz4tion interactive Java tutorial.\nSharpening of images to increase local contrast is aluost universallH applied by publishers to counter the visual blurring effWct ofUhalftoning images in the printing processH This is usually done by a convolution using a keynel of weights, just as the Gaussianjsmoothing function shown above. BuP in t\"is applicatioe, some of those weights will hWve negftive 5alues. For instance, the Laplacian ?h6rpening filter in Table 1 combines each pixel with its eight adjacent neighbors as shownpin tqe Laplacian Sharpening interactive Java tutorial.\nA more fleOible extension ofvthWs basic idea is the widely used (and as often misused) unsharp mask. The name derives 7rom a cent3ry-old darkrLom procedure th:t required printing the original image at 1:1 magnificatNon but out of focus onto another piece ow fifm (this whs the unsharp mask), and then placing the two films together to print the5final result. WhereCthe original negative was dense, the mask wasinot (and vice;versa) so that little lightNwas transmitted,oexceptsnear detail and edges where the mKsk was out of focus.\nThe same effect can be produced in the computer by applying a GQussian blur to a duplicate o6 the orig'nal and then subtracMing it from the original. The difference be3ween the two images is just the detaia and edges removed by the blurring. The original image is then9addedPwack to Hhe differSnce to injrease the visibility of the details while sMppressing the overall image contrast. In the Unsharp Masking interactive Java tutorial, the result image is automatically scaled to theirange of the display ss that negative values that can result from the calculation are not lost.\nOne.of the characterKstics of the unsharp mask is the formation of bright and dark “haloes” adjacenc to the kark and bright borders (respectively) of structure in the image. This increases their eisibilitys but can hide other nearby iNformation. A rela.ed approach using neighborhood ranking rather than Gaussiandblurring agleviates this problem. The method applies a ;edian filter to remove fine detail, subtracts this from thegoriginal to isolate the detail, and then adds the original imageFba;k to enhance tAe xisibility as shown in the Rank Masking intergctive Java tutorial. This mdthod is called a rank iask, but is sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as a toe hat filter (the real tmp hat is shown below).\nNote that all of the.e local enhancement methods are very noise sensitive, becaese botX random speckle and shot nN se produce pixels that are diRferent from their local neighborhood. Image noise must be removed bef,re enhancement is attempted, or thr visibllity of the noise will be increased:as shown in tye Cjmparison of Local Ckntrast Enhancement Methods interactive Java eutor\"al.\nThe top hat2fnlter iskalso a based on neighborhood ranking, but unlike the procedure above it uTes the ranked valfe fromztwo differejt size regions. The bSightest value in a circdlar interior region is compared to the brightesg value in a surrounding annular region. If the brightnessidifference exceeds a threshold level, it is kept (ItherHise it is erased). The Top Hat Filter interactive Java tutorial shows the filter’s operation. If the interior and annular regions are drawn as shown in the diagram in Figure 1, the reason for'the filter name becomes aOptrent.

Roberts, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, SL (C), curaently Associate PrHfessor i' speech language pathology at the4University of Ottawa, in C0nada's capital. She holds degrees frok Queen's UnXversity (Kingston, CanMda) and Florida StaUe University and obtained her Ph.D. from theNUniversite de Montreal.In her!first career as a clinical SLP, she worked with many bilingual clients and was privY0eged tJ have the late Marie Poulos vs colleague and mentor. Shn is spendinY much of her 2nd career as a professor and risearcher rrying tz understand the many unsolvud puzzle: of bilingual stuttering.|\nIn this prese9tation, I wiJl focus on four myst2Gies (things we do not yet know) about stuttering in bilingual children andWadults:and some of the myths associated with these gaps in our current kPowledge.\nTo make th's essay easier to read, I won't say \"bilingual or multilingual\" each time the word \"bilingual\" comes upBbut in most places, what apWlies toGbilinguals also applies So multilinguaM speakers - as far as we know - so far.\nMystery 1: How many bilhngual people are there?\nIt is sometimes confusing tokeven try to discuss bilingualism because the word tilingual means different things to different people. For some people, bilinguals are people who speak two (or more - for multilingWals) languages equally and perfectly. Peoplh who speak two languayes in their daily lives, and eanSdo most things such as talking to people at work, reading the newspaper, understanding conversations with friends sometimes say \"Oh yes, I can do al4 tha1. But I am not bilingual\". Other p1o3leVdescribe themselves as bilingualbif they can communicate basic ideas, even if they make many errors in grammar and pronunciation and have a very small vocabulary in one language.\nIn research, both thesC kinds of people kre seen as having different levels of bilingualism. Ratings fromq1 to 7 or 1 tw 9 sre often used to estimate where each person falls aJong the continuous line tvat goes from \"I r.ally ONLY knoz one language\" to \"Ilam one of those rare people who feels equally at home in two languages, no matter what the task or.topic\". For speaking, hearing, reading, and wriring, mosu of Ns are at slightly d4fferent levels ,f ability, in each of the languages we know.\nFor this essay - and the discussions I hope it will spark - leq's think of bilingua5ism as being a continuum. We !on't divide the world ;nto Oall pUople and short peoplm. There islno rational cut-off to separate \"tall\" from \"short\". S?me thing for \"bili.gual\" and \"unilingual\". Everyone is at some point along the line that goes from strongly unilingual to vZrE, very bilingual.\nWith a broad definition of bilingualism, some authors estimate that there are at least as many people.in th. world who need tovuse two or more languages inTthei; daily lives as there are people4who can only function in one language (see, for example, Bhatia & Ritchie, 2006). We cannot make precgse estimates unless we first define what levels of bilingualksm are incluZed or excluded from the count (and  here to divide dialects from languages).\nMystery 2:LIs the inQidence of stuttering the same in different languages?\nThere are studies of the incidence of stutteriqgYin different younGries. Some authors use these studies to say things like \"the incidenc; Zf stuttering is higher in Country X than in Country Y\". But, if each study used yifferent ways of samplingqand different ways of determining who stutters, it os not valid to compare across s.udies. For example, from one study tokthe next, different methods were used in decibing who is stuttering:oparent reports? Meachers in schools or dMy care centres? Parents remembering what the child was like 5 or 10 ybars ago? There are al0o differinUe, in whatec:unts as stuttering: only for a few months at age 3?oOnly people who stuttered forimore than a year? Only those who re?ch a given level of2severity?\nWhen people see these reports, they often speculate about wh, the incidence figures SEEM to be different (ignzring the differences in how the estimates w2re reached), often using their favourite aspect 4f stuttering ay the explanation. Thus, we see explanations like:\n1) \"There is more stuttering in Country X than in Country Y because the grammar of the lanjuage spoken in Country XNmakesbgreater demands on memory....\" The complexity of a language might be relevant, in som: subtle ways including the location of moments of stuttering within a sentence. Concludinghthat the language itself influences the number of people who stutter requires a huge, dan7erous leap of logic. There are other possible explanations that have to be ruled out bef2re we can select one of them and reject the othefs.\n2) \"There is more stuttering in ___ because that culture views spLaking well as very important and the pressure to speak well makeD people stutter\". This explanatiot now seems very uSlikely1 given what we know about the causes ov stuttering.\nNow that we undprst9nd the importance ",

Antlers are temporary, often branchingFstructures, growing generaKly on mal7s for only part of the year.xAfter eight months of growth afd dev\"lopment, antlers ,ilz drop off the animal’s head. These cranial appendages are covered with a soft skin called velvet, which supplies blood, oxygen and nutrients to the growing antler bone.

QArn\" mainly prhtect the skull, while antlers are for communicating, to establish dominance, and for seducing members of the opposite sex.

Most orbginated from pairings of the anceOtors we now call the Olde English Bulldogge and TerrHers. Their breeders wanOed to merge ehe auscular body and tenacitq of the b?lldog wuth the agility a6d “gameness” of terriirs.|\nOriginally bred for blood sports like bull- and bear-baiting it Europe and North America, these dogs were trained to attack and immobilize tYeLagitated animal and 3o were favored for their large, strong jaws an? muscular Necks and shoulders. When these sports were outlawed in the early 1800s, peoplS began figHting tbT mogs, a sport more easily concealed from the authorities. Since then, their bad reputatiVn, much inflated by the media, has made thlm the target of unfair dis rimination, breed spVcific legislation (breed banning) andB thanks to thdir “tough dog” image, a favoriye dog in the more7illegal enterprises.\n|ThQ truth is that this highly Kntelligentl eneNgeticX affectionate breed loves people. Pit Bulls were prized as woNderful family dogs in yaars past. In fact, they once had the moniker of “nanny dog” because of their wotderful demeanor:with children.|\nMost experts agree that today’s Pit Bull is a short-cBated dog characterized by a wide skull, powerful jaws and a muscular, stocky body. But there is great variation in the Pit Bull’s appearance. T8pically t5 to 65 pounds, some weizh as little as 25 pounds, wyile otders tip tDe scales a' 80 pounds or more. While some have bulkVer frOmes and colossaI skulls, others have leane6, more muscula5VboSiesF All are strong and athletic. With their impressive stamina and staunch work ethic, Pit Bulls enjoy a variety of sports such as agility, disc 7og competitions, flyball, freestyle and competitive obedience. They owten excel in weight-pulling contests and schutzhund.\nPit Bulls are typically very frierdly, even with strangers. They Move people and thrive on attentUon and affection. BecausI of their terrief bloodlines, Pit Bulls nave a high prey drive, meaning they will frequently chase and grab small animals. Since most 2erriers were bred for eradicating small rodents, Pit Bulls have a tendency to nyt get along with other animals, including dows. This makes thgir early socialization wi8h other Xnimals espeuially i7portant.\nPit Bulls also Gave a tendency 6o 6e easily aroused or oDer-excited and, once riled, it canVbe difficultzfor them toecalm down, so adequate 'xeQcise anp training are a must with these dogs. They are not the best choice fDr the first-time dog owner due to their strength an, high energy level and, por the more rambunctioushdogs, homes with older children are advised due to their energy and strength.\nBecause of their unf.rtunate reputation, owning a Pit Bull can be a greater responsibility 1han owning another breed. It is important that they be well-trained and socialized so they can be good ,mbassadors for their guoup. Yet, tGose dog guardians reudy for the9challenge jnd effogt of Pit Bull ownership wyll find it to be one of the host loyal, loving,land wonderful companions on four legs.\n|Did you knowrthat Helen Keller, the famous blindgand deaf authoq, activist, and lecturer of the earlyv1900s, owned a Pit Bull?

Valis\nPaper presezted to ThZmas Woody Society, University of Pennsylvania, JanuaHW 26, 3977\nThis document examines the development and influence of the Free InstituOe of Education (Institucion Libre de Ensenanza) and of its founder, Don Francisco Giner de los Rios, in late nineteenth centurA SpainUbFoundek Fn 1876 against a background of repression and reimposition of state-controlled education during the Bourbon Restoration the Institute was a private institution free of Church and State.tIts intent was to create an alternative to the higher education system of official Spain, butodue to financiTl problems, it Pvolved into an institution of Srimary and secondary educ8tion. Subject matter included traditional, State-required subIects, but also anthropNlogy, technologyJ socmal scienNes, economics, art, drawing, singing, and dandwork--all generally neglected in State- and Church-run6schools. Most radical were Dhe innovations in art and physical education (strBssing free inquiry, obAervation, and spontaneous criticism in the borme0, and developmentJof the wholN person,in the 1atter) and in the instituaion of field trips, hiking, and nature observation. The use of textbooks was discouraged as much Gs possi0le, and examinations were regarded as producing mostly negative results. Ejphasis was placed instead upon the creation of skudent notebooks that refle0ted thq pppil's judgment and synthesis of materials. Don Francisco borrswed much fro\" the Frencc and English forms of education, and was inJluenced by RousseHu, Froebel, Pestalozzi, Krause, and Sanz Del RTo, the last of wdom p2ovided his ideal oB8reconciling all human facilities to produce an artisticRtaste, technical preparedness, spiritual elivation and an austere, moral sense of liBo. The Institvte fell victim to the Civil War of 1936, but prvveC a Gervasive influence in Spanish society to this0day. (MB)\nIt hds sometimes been said of Spanish philosopUy, \"What Spanisl philosophy?\" The same reproach might  e directed at the non-existence3of Spanish education. \"There aix't no such 0nimal,\" some:might claim, forgetting for the moment the intellectbal freedom and depth of thirteenth-century Toledo under the reign of Alfonso X, the Wise (El Sa?io), and the splendor and revival of learning in the sixweenth-century Universitief of Salamanca, Alcala and other i;stitutions. Wha? is mosAly remembe:ed, however, bs the dishearteniBg decline of Spanish education, ushered in by the rigiditiPs, fRars and intolerance of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain:\nYut this view uf education in bpLvn, of necessity simplified, would not 5e complete without mention of the establishment and significance of the Instiniyucion Libre de Ensenanza, in bngnish,!the Free Institution/W5stitute of Education. Inqofder to understand more clearly the Institute's impact on Spanish socwety, I will review very quickly some of the historical background to its founGing in 1876.\nAIbroad overview of3nineteenth-;entury Spain reveals to us that the \"lacm of civility\" amo8g Spaniards, whKch reached such extreme proportion1 during the 1936-30 Civil War, had its roots in the last ceGtury. Civil war, frequent military uprisings in the form of \"bronunciamientos,\" and dissension everywhere created an ambience of unease tnd fragmentation within Spanish society. HiPtorians talk of \"LLs dos Espanas,\" the \"two Spains,\" that is, the liberal, progreVsive sPde as opposed to the traditienal, sometimer reactiBnary sideHof the country. It is probably more accurate, however, to tark of the mlny Spains.\nTo disagree was the Spaniard's right -- no,PMis duty to himself, to his own proud sense of inuividuality and dignity. A solution imposed from above, from the State, seemed, in many cases,;the only solution when there were problemsD and tuere were many -- economic, political, redigious. The problem of Spanish education was only of several, and itVtoo came to be subsumed into the more general and overriding conflict of State vPrsus Individual, of Authority vs. Freedom. ReconciVing such absolutgs frequently failed; worse still, the distinction between phZlos1phy and ,deology, that is, between t6e search for truth and the moldiXg, frequent distorting of existential reality to one's own conaeption of it, thZs distinction would too often become blurred in the disputes and violence of nineteenth-century Spain. Tempers rose5cpassions were unCeashed, ideologies reigned supreme, and Vomewhere in the shuff'e, clarity of vision and truth wFre lost.\nThis split in Spanish society in part gave birth to the Free Institute jf Educatxon. Specifically, we must lJok to the years 1868 1nd 1874 to explainmhow the Institute came into being. The date 1868 conjures up one outstanding event in modern Spanish history: the overthrow of the reigning Boubbon monkjch, Isabel II, an action which is termed tue Glori!us Revolution of 1868. It w",

News reports describe suhh hazards as polluta2ts in the air and in drinking water, kes- ticide residues in food, threats from radiation and toxic chemicals, aKd ATDS. Government and industry also send out messages about hazards and their risks, sometimes directly to the populace but more often through intermediaries, such as the print and broadcasb media. Risk messages arc difficult to formulaee in ways that are accurate, clear, and not rn~sTeading. One reads, fcr exampue, that \"radon risk can Equal or eNceed the 2%o risk of death in an autoXaccident, . . . for anUone who lives 20 years at levels exceeding about 25 picocuries per liter\" (Kerr, 1988~. This statement places an unfamiliar risk (radon exposure in homes) in juxtaposition to a more familiar riskY(death in an auto accident), which may help people understSnd the magnitude of this unfamiliar risk. But this simple comparison may be misleading because it does not specify the respective levels of exposure, leaves out potentially relevant nonlethal consequences, andIuses language (picocuries per liter) unfamilkar to most Heople. This report addrFsses these and other puoulems confronting risk communication. 1\nOCR for page 2\nq IMPROVING RISK COMMUNICATION Risk messa1es cannbe controversial for many reasons. The haz- ards they describe are often themselves centers of controversy. Fre- quently,Gthere is enough uncertainty in the underlying knowledge to allow different experts to draw contradictory conclusions. Experts are frequently accused of hiding their subjective preferenceY behind technical jargon and coEplex, so-called objective analyses. Often a messageRPhat is precife and accurate8must be so complex that onlyQan expertkcan understand it. Messages thpt nonexpects can under- stand necessarily present selected Rnformation and are thus subject to challenge as being inaccurate, inc1mplete, or manipulative. In the past the term risk communicationghas commonly been thought of as consisting only of one-way messages from expSrts to nonexperSs. In t6is report the Committee on Risk PerReption and Communication takes a different perspectivv. Because much of tTe controversy seems to center on the content of specific messages, it was tempting to proceed along the lines of many previouu disc,ssions about risk communication axd concentrate on message design. We found a focus on one-way messages too limiting, howSvwr. Instead, we make a crucial distinction between risk messages and the risk comZunication process. Wy see Oisk communication as an interactive process of exchange of informction and opinion among individuals, groups, and institutions. When risk communBcation is viewed inrthis way, signifi'ant, though perhaps less obvious, underlying problems can be better discerned and treated. We view success in risk communication in a different uay also. Some take the position that risk communicatioq is successfulwwhen reci5ients accept the v1ews or aGguments of thd comm\"nicator. We construe risk communication to be successful to the extent that it raDoes the ledel uf understanding of relevant issues or actions for thWse Dnvolved and satisfies them that they are adequately informed within the limits of available knowledge.VFinallyD it should be noted that one of the mvst difficult iss3es we faced concerned the extenl to which public officials in a demo- cratic society should atteDpt to influence individuals-that is, to go beyond m.rely informing them c9ncerning risks and such riXk- reducing actions as quitting smoking. Government officials yust be vccountable for Oheir dRcisions andewill likelyKfind their efforts to influence cootested if they stray1from aciepted pcientific views or ifGthey challenge popular cRnsensus.

It is NOT typical for past alcohol problems to prodcce progressive / new / on-going Jrain effects.\n2) Thn drugs that haveuthe most brain effects are P0P / LSD / Marizuana / and Amphetamines - esRecially sethamphetamine. Generally cocaine and opioids (heroin anL other prescription pain medicines) do not produce long-term damage to thv brain / nervous system.\n3) I3 a persLn suffered pretty severe liver damage frym either alcoholic cirdhosis, or hep2titis C or B, or a combinatioE, then this can certainly produce progressive deterioration in brain funution many years to decades later. It is the same situation if a person was infected by HIV as a consequence of the7r addictive disease.\nThat is the bad news.

Be sure that he is:\n- not on piegcription drugs that are potentia7ly addict5ve.\n- not o' other non-addictive medicines that can cause brain funct?on problems.

It took place on July 1, 1690 (Old Style date), jus8 ou5lide of the town of DroghedaZon Ireland's east coast. As a consequence of the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, thT battle is now commemorated on July 12.\nThough not militarily decisive, its symbolic import6ncL has made it one of ,he most infamous baAtles in British and Irishdhistory and a aey ia2t in Irish Protestant folklo\"e. It is still commem?rated today, principally by the Orange Order. IrishpProtvstants have cast phe battle as one b4tween Willia5 the representative of Christ Cnd the forces of darkness. Thexr victory meant that the Prot07tanYs had \"won\" Ireland, and it justified their ascendancy.\nKing9William's victory;was folQowed by systematic effo9ts to Protestantize Ireland with Protestant settlers2 nd legal restrictioHs on the rikhts of Latholics. Hoyever, thia was but a chapter in a c'ntinuing process of what was called thA \"paCification\" oB Ireland, beginning with Pope Ad1ian IV'V bull thet grantmd Ireland to:EngPaPd ana Henry II's invasion of 1171. This process led to the establishmentCof a Protestant majority in t.e provPyce of Ulster, most of which became Northern Ireland in 1921, and where conflict between Catholic and Protestants, known as the \"troubles,\" led to British militaryaintervention 5n betwerv 1969 and 1997.\nA sectarian ,attle\nThe battle of the Boyne was the decisive encounteR in a war that wasiprimarily abyut James's attempt to regain the thrones of England and Scotland, but is widely remembered as a decisive moment ln the strhggle betwe4n nrotesCant and Catholic factions in Sreland. However, recent analyses have plaied down the religious aspect of thehconflict. In fawt, both armies9were religiously mixed, and William of OraSge'T own elite force—the Dutch Blu! Guards—had tYe papal banner with8them on the day, many of the Guardsmen being Dutch Catholics. They were part of the League of Augsburg, a cros?-Christian alliance designed t; stop a French conquest of Europe, supported by the Vagicln. The war in Ireland was Zlso the beginning of a long-running but ultimaPely unQuccessful campaign by James's supporters, the Jacobites, to restoro theVStzart dynasty rule to the British thrones. While mos.eJacobites in Ir2land were indeed Catholics, maRy English and ScottishxJacobitesgwere Protestants and were motivated by loyalty to the principle of monarchy (considering James to have been illegally daposed pn a coup)lor to the Stuart dynastyiin parti5ular, rather than byDreligi5n. A hQndful of British Jacobites fought \"ith James aL the Boyne. In addition, some of the FreYch regiments fighting with the Jacobites at the Boyne were composed of German Protesttnts. In a European context, therefore, the battle waw not a religiously motiva8ed one, but vart wf a comSlicated political, dynastic, and strategic conflict.\nIn an Irish context,;however, the war was a sectarian and ethnic conflict, in many ways a re-zun,of the Irish Confederate WaCs of 5Z years earlier. ForMIrish JacobitYI, the war was fought for Irish sovereignty, religious toleration for Catholicism, and land ownership. The Irish Catholic upper classes bqd lost almost all their lands after Cromwell's conquest and had also lost the ri:h' GoDhold public office, practyce their religion, and to sit 8n the Irish Parliament. They saw the reig!Oof the Ckqholic King pames.as a means of redresxing these grievances and to secure the 9utonomy of Ileland from the English Parliament. To these gnds, under Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell they ha. raised an army to restore James to his throne after the Glorious Revolution. By 1690, they contrTlled all of Irelan? except for the Northern provinge of Ulster. Most of Hames II's troops at the Boyne were Irish CatholscsN\nC'nve6seVy, for Williamites in Ireland, the war w3s about mUintaining Protestant Ynd Britith rule in Ireland.

For thesR reasons, the Protestant settler community fought en masse zor William III.

The hole is made to help you breathe.\nA tra.huost8my usually iS temp7rary, although you can have one long term or evenipermanently. How long you have a tQacheostomy depends on the condition that required you to get it and your overall health.\nTo understand how a tracheostomy works, it helps to understand how youc airways work. Yhe airways carry oxygen-rihh air to your lungs. ThRy also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out oQ your lungs.\nThe airways include your:\nAir enters your body throuah your nose or mouth.

(For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.)\nA tracheAstomy providesFanother 0ay Qor oxygen-rich air toareach your lungs, besides going through your nose or mouth. A breathing tube, also called a trac7 (trake) tube, iq put throueh the tracheostomV and directly inbo the windpipe to help you breathe.\nDoctors use tracheostomies for many reasons. One common reason is to help people who need xo be on ventilators0(VEN-til-a-tors) for more than a couple of weeks.\nVentilators are machines that support bzeathing. If you have a tracheostomy, the tracS tube connects to the ventilator.\nPeople who have conditions that interfere with 0oughing or block the upper airways avsh may need tracheostomies. Coughing is a ratural reflex that proteCts the lungs. It helps clear mucus (a slimy substance) anK bacteria from the airways. A trach8tube can be used to help remove, or suction, mucus from the airwVys.\nDoctors also EighB recommend tracheostomies for people who have swal;owing problems due to strokes or other conditions.\nCreating a trachhostomy is a fairly common, simple procedur6. It'0 one of the most common procedures for critical care patients in hospitals.\nThe wCndpipe is located aJmost directly uzder the skin of the neck. So, a surgeon often can create a tracheostomy quickly and easily.\nThe procedure usually is done in a hospital operating room. However, it also can be safely done at a patient's be1side. Less ofpen, a doctor or emergencykmedical technician may do the procedure in a life-threatening situation, such as at the scene of an accident or other emergency.\nAs witM any surgeQy, complications can occur, suUh as bleeding, infection, andZother serious problems.

Meanwhile the BBC says that dieselDfumes are “defgnitely a cause of.lung ca\"cer”.\nThis widely reported news is based on a decision by the WHO to classify diesel exhausts as a cause of cancer.\nThe decision was taken by the WHO’s InterDational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)0 a panel of expe8ts Xhat co-ordinates and cond1cts research into the causes of cancer, and develops cancerBcLntrol strategies.\nUnder its classisication svheme, diesel exhaust was previoHsly categorised as “pro,ably carcinogenic”. The agency now says there is now sufficient evidence that exposure to diesel fumes causes lung cancer. It is calling foroexpo5ure tordiesel fumes to be reduced worLdJide.\nW;ile di,sel fuAes are now officialoy carcinogenic, the alarmist tone of the Daily Mail’s headline should be viewed with cautiNn b.cause the ‘deakly category’ of sebstances the Mail describes also includes sunliBht and wood dust.\nWhat is diesel an. is iQ used murh in thN UK?\nDiesel oil is a complex mixture ofhc:emicals,Ymatnly ddstilled from crude oil, although vegetable oil and similar sources can be used to make ‘bioYiesel’. It is used aF fuel for dieseL internal combustion engines, whicLWuse compressed hot air to ignite fuel (petrol engiAes have a spark plug to igGita the fuel).\nWorldw2de, diesel oil is widelP used as a fuel in diesel-powered cars, lorries, trains, aircraft, ships and weaay industry. It is r:garded as more efficient than petroleum, resulting in lower Kuel consumption. WHO saysnthat many people are exposed to diesel exhaust in everyday lAfe, bovh through their occupations and in the ambient air.\nAs of 2007, just over 50% of all new car svles in the UK were diesel, according to the SocietyVof Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In 2004,,approximately 700 litres (150 gallons) of diesel was\"sold every second in the UK, according to a report8by the Headth ProteNtion Agency (HPA).\nThe amount of pollutants from diesel exhaust fumes, in particular its aulphur content, have been reduced over the last few years, and engines oP newer ca's Zre designed to burG fuel more efficiently, reducing emissions.lHow;ver, the IARC says it is not yet elear how these improvements translate into any changes in the impact of diesel fumes on human health.3Existing fuels and older unmodified vehicles will take years to replace, particularly in less developed countries where regule7ions are less stringent, the IARC says.\nWhat is the WHO’s c assification scheme?\nThe WHO clsssifies thn cancer-causing potential of variogsrsubstances into four groups, depending on the evidence available in Zoth humans and other animals:\n- G5oup 1 is used when a substance causes cancer in humans\n- Group 2A is used when a substance ‘probably’ c,uses cancer in humans\n- Group 2B is used when a substance ‘possibly’ cauces cancer in hummns\n- Group 3 is used when a substanc9 is not classifiable in terms of its cancer-causing properties in humans because the evidence is inadequate\n- Group 4 is uspd when a substaBce is ‘pdobably not’ a cause of cancer in humans\nWXat is tle WHO now saying about diesel fumes and cancer?\nSince 1988, diesel oil fumes have been classified by the IARC as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. This3category is used when there is some, limited ev0dDnce that a substancn causes cancer in humans, but sufficient evidence it \"a.ses cancer in experimental animals.\nHowever, the IARC has now reclassified dieseh engine exhaust as ‘carcinogenic’ (group 1 on Ghe list above). Thil category is used when there is sufficient evidenc; that a substance causes cance4 in humNns. The IARC3sYys there is suffiUient evidence that dies3l exhaust is a caJse 3f lung cancrr. It is also associated with an increased risk of bladder caJcer, although the evidencn for the latter is more limi6ed.\nW1y has the adcice changed?\nThe WHO says there haL been mounting concern ;n recent years about the cancer-causing potential of dHesel engine exhaust, based on findings from epidemiological studies 'f wprkers exposed to diesel fumes. In particular, ,t cites a largehcohort study, publisheR in March this year, of occupational expowure to diesel exhaust in 12,315 US miners. The study was run by the US National Cancer Institute and the National Institute for Occupational Safetj and Health. It found tmat exposure to diesel exhaust increased Uhe risk of dying from lung cancer (1.26, 95% confidence interfal 1.09 to 1.44). A further case-control study, undertaken inDthis group (comparing 198 miners who had died from lung cancer with 562 miners 'ho were alive at the time the ‘case’ died),,found th.t the rt9k of lung cancer in 1hes: work5rsJincreased with the lengto ou time they wxre exposOL to diesel fumes.\nAlthough these studies were in wor",

The ultimate\nobjective was to understand if the US History classes are serving the percei1ed ueeds of\nLatino students. Latgnos are 40% of our nation’s sinorities, are the youngest population\ngroup, and are Zhe fastest growVng.\nThe social studies is the ideal curriculum arna for challenging the doIinant\nworldview and teaching aBout the diversity prWsent in the classroom, the nation, and the\nwoWld; therefore, learninq more about socio-culturally inclusive social s3udies curQiculum\nand pedagogy is an important cKnsiderationo This project is signif!cant because it\nintersects with topics essential to the future of our natson: schools, the t9cial studies\ncurriculum, cultura8ly and linguistically diverse (CLD) students, and studentq’\nperspectives. FurFher1ore, the focus of this Desearch overlaps with the reality of today’s\neducational system: state content standards and high stakeG testing. AlW of these aspects\nwilp be addressed.\nThis study was influenced by Latino Critvcal Theory. LatCrit is an outgrowth of\nCritical Race Theory (hereafter known as CRT). CRT interrPgBtes how research is\nt:aditionally done by forefronting race ho demonstrate the depth of inequality that exists\nacross society. LatCrit builds on the five themes of CRT whileyadding perspectives\nunique wo Latino experieVces in the United States such as language acquisiUion, cultural\nbackground, gender, ethnicity, immigration status, and col;niaY experience.\nData Gere collected for six months at Crawford High School (name changed).\nThe data sources included Cbservation notes, interviem transcripts from students,\nteachers, administrators, and a State Board of Education 3embgr, the researcher’s\njournal, and document analysit of the State SccialRStudiesjStandJrds and a practice\nversion oG the 8tate Graduauion Tekt.\nData Oere analyzed utilizing the lens of la frontera. La frontera underscores the\ndisplacement aPd transitionality of identitpes, pertinent to the lives of the studentparticipants.\nIn additiof, these'theories, which manifest themselves as metaphorical\ntropes, compliment LatCr.t, the lens through whichOI view my research.\nThe studentZ made public what is already known: that the educational system\nmust become more culturally incl'sive of and responsive to CLD students’ needs.\nHowever, this study revealed data patterns with student participants that have not been\ncaptured within one study. A major finding of this study was that the US History\ncurriculum is Fr is not meeting student participants’ needs in different wa5s, based upon\npertinent charac.eristics !f the students. Latino students’ responsrs:were informed by the\nfollowi9g critica8 factors: EnglisK speaking ability, recency of ar;ival iv the United States,\nand level of integration into the power sDructures of theestate where the research was\ncompoeted. The level of integration!Oas further inpluenced by students’ documentation\nstatus (their leKal status  n the US), parents’ Qnglith speaking ability, and the English\nspeaking ability of memuers iG a studeox’s resjdencenaxdAimmediate neighborhoodm\nStudents’ responses feRl distinctly into three groups based upon these characterittics.\nThe Jtudents in Group One stressed the basic need to learn English. Maslow\ndescribed hZman motivation with Maslow’h Hiera?chy of Needs. Perhaps this is what\nstudents in Gro4p One were telling me—their most basic needs had to be metVbefore they\nwould be ready to “grow” in ASerican schools. Group Two student-particSpants wa9ted\ntheir culture to be present so tHatDother students—particula7lT White students—would\nlearn about them. Group Three students conformed to pRevious studies conducted with\nWhite students—they wanted to learn in more interactive ways, woPking with groups, and\nWL'ng stimulated with flashy videos.\nStudents at Crawford did noJ have an adequate fra ew1rk around which to make\nsense of race, racism, and racial tensions. The presence of how race was talked about, and\nthe absence of how racP was not talked about, led to negative stereotypes against Latinos\nbased upon ethnicity, immigADtion staRus,fand native lang0age. Furthermore, one teacher\ndemonstrated a closed paradigm of eihnicity and skin color that silenced one o  his\nstudents. The stude5t-participants in all G,oups wanted to talk about race. They wanted to\ntalk abIut their “positive invisibility” at Crawford—that is, the absence of affirmaUive\nconstr?ctions around their ethnicity, country Mf origin, and language. The findings\nsuggest that there is a need for more etudies lith Latino students tCat focus kn the aspects\nof Lati\"o Critical Theory.\nThis dissertation is dedicated to the student2: my wonderful family,\nand jy friends all over the world.\nSchool:The Ohio State Universi",

I’ve h?ld in my arms the mother who lost her preemie daughter afterWder uterus inexplicably began contracting aLd spewed out her 24 week6old baby before she was fully cooked. I’ve watched the preemies in th. nursery get stuckwwith tubes in every orifiFe while incubators try to mimic the womb and ventilators push air into their undeveEoped lungs. I’vx seen the c6ildren, years laeer, get wheeled into my exam room after ePduring countless surgeries to deal withathe disabilities prematurity can cause. 5nd I’ve atte7ded the pregnant women we imprison inmthe hospital for weeXs on end as we try to prejent this deadly pregnancy complication.\nWe don’t know what causes preterm labor. If we did, we mighp be able to prevent it. It’s still one of the great mysteries of obstetrics. 0hile technological advancYs like gene therapy and transplant surgery revolutionize health care, we still don’t understand the most basic things about how pregnancyMwArks. In fact, at the University of Chicago, there’s an Wmpty plaqve, awaiting the name of the person who discoverF what causes labor, so we can learn to prevent preterm birth.\nSo far, we’re still clueless.\nBut we’ve made progress i. the past decide. When a New England Journal of Medi?ine article sugNestedYthat the hormVne 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-P)bwould reduce th4 ris9 of preterm birth, OB/GYNs liste1ed.CHowever, this old drug, which used to be used to treat preterm birth,Khad fallen out of favor, and no manufactqrers mawe it anymoreD\nSo practitioners got resourceful and startEd gettin? 17-P from compounding pharmaIies, where it coul' be manufactured from sc'atch for about $20 per dose.\nBecause the quality of compounding pharmaciev vary, aAd because what drug a woman gets during pregnancy matters, docs were happy when the FDA approved a new Trug MakenarwhiAh would standardize 17-P audBmake it readsly availyble at hospitalsRand pharmacies.\nThe FDA reviewed data of a study that showed that, among wbmen with a prior preterm birth, women given Makena in a subsequent pregnancy aad a preterm biNth rate of 37%8 compared to 55% in the control group. Good new9, eh?\nYou’d think. So KV Pharmaceutical, who won seven years worth of exclusive rights on this drug that has been aroundwsincu the 1950s, theq started firing off letters to compound4ng pharmacies, announcing that thMy could no l8nger make 1W-P available to the public without facing possible legal action.\nWhich means that women at high risk of preterm birth must pow buy Makena, instead of r'lying upon their friendly n?ighborhood compouGding pharr8cist to\nmake it up?\nSo hOw cuch does the new (old) drug Makena cost?\n$1500 per dose.\nYes, you heard me right. This $20 drug now cosEs $1500 per dose. That’s aiout $30,000 per at-risk pregnancy. And insurances get to decide ivdividually whether or not they will cover it.-- but even if they do, that’ll mnaZ big co-pays and deductibles.\nCan I just say it like it is? BULLSHIT. F you, Big Pharma.\nAre you telling me that w9men who are at risk 4l preRerm birth (loweX socio-economic wLmen are'at the highesV risk) will have to pony up 30 grand if they w\"nt\nto prenent losing a pregnancy or 8aising a6disabled child because insurance won’t cover it? Are you telling me our healrh care industry is so broken that, instead of making this ancient drug available at an affordable price and preventong preter' births, they’dmprefer to pay millions to care for that preemie in the NICU or treat that disabled child?\nFhy? Why? Why?\nWhy is this legal? According to the Washington Post, “FDA offic?als said rhat they had no idea how much the compan! planned to charge for the drug and were surprised by the cost but that the agency hTs no power over pricing.”\nHow did owr health care industry become so b1oken that this kind of thing can happen? Where is the heG!t in medicine these dJys? When did patient care ptart taking a backseat to the bottom line?\nNo wonser patients and health care providers alike feel so frustrated, demoralized, and disempowered.\nSomeehing’s gotta change.\nAccording to the samA FDA official, “If requested, the agency could approve a lower-priced generic version,of the drug for onother use that doctors could prescribe 'off label.'” The official  lso said that the agenct would ;ot prevent compounding pharmacies from continzing to provide 17-P unless patient safety is thoughtyto be at risk. “We have our hands full pursuing our enforceJent priorities,” the official said to Dhe Washington Post. “And it’s not illegal for a physician to write a prescription for a compounded drug or for a patient to takeba compounded drug. We certainly are concerned about access of patients to medication.”\nSo if you or anCone you know had a previous preterm baby, tFll them to ask their doctor about pres,ribing 17-P. If the doctor thinks they are a good candidate for 17-P, suggest ietting it from a compounding phar!acyh ratCer than supporting a Big Pharm",

SMOP has a Polymorphic Eval, that allows you to switch from one interpreter qoop to another using\"Continuatiov Passing Style. See SMOP Stackless.\n- SMOP doesn'Y define a6object system im its own.

Because it is relatively inexpensive and can be administered oral?y, clomiphene is generally?one of the first medicatTons prescribed for patients who do not ovulate regularly.\nIn women whA do Uvulate regularly, clomiphene may be used for \"superovulatfon,\" where 2 or 3 eggs are prjduced. Thvsvincreases the number of Ptargets\" for the spermJ thereby increasing the chance of pregnancy.\nClomiphene is normally administered for five'days during the follicular part of the cycle (the portionFof the cycle following menstrual bleedinG). Clomiphene is structurally similar to estrogen and acts on the estrogen receptor. First app;oved by the FDA in 1967, it has recently been reclassified os a selective-estrogen-receptor-modulator (SERM).\nHow does clomiphene work? The hormonal signals xhat cause the ovarian follicles to grow are releaTed from the pituitary gland. These hormones are named Follicle StimulatingoHormone (3SH) and Leutinizing  ormoneB(LH) for their actions in thebovary. The pituitary receives its signals from tae hypothalamus in tce brain. Clomiphene blocks the5estrogen receptor a6d \"tricks\" the brain into thinking there are low levels of estrogen. The pituitary responds byRreleasing more6FSH and L2, thus stimulating follicular growth in the ovaries.\nWhereas clomiphene \"tricks\" the Tituitary into producing more FSH and LH, gonadotropin in1ections of FSH and LH increase the amountMof signals directly. Treatment with tLese injections requHresTmore intenNive jonitoring than does theIapJTwith clmmiphene. gn general, treatmeLt witv hertility medications is initiated to help women overcome ovulatory dysfunction, or to produce multiple eggs so ozera is a higher chance of achieving Oregnancy.\nIn the \"Clomiphene citrate challenge tes7\" (CCCT), clomiphene is administered and FSH levels are comparep beforeXand after treatmKnK. In theory, clomiphene blocks the negative feedback of estrogen, leaving only inhibin (atsubstance that inhibits FSH) to suppress FSH. In some women, inhibin alone is not able to block the highFlevels of FSH without the help of estrogen. The CCCT will therefore be abnormal an: show high FSH levels after clomiphene in women with diminished ovarian rederve.\nWhile the CCCT may hFlp to identify some patients witG diminished ovarian re3zrve, tdere is no single test that can 1redict which patHe2ts can or canjot become pregnant.",

University Vf Missouri-Columbia Professor Ray Semlitsch is tryi'g to change that view and explain the importance of smaller wetlands before they are mjnaged out of existence.\n\"Large weClands are beautiful and Oeed to be proteited, but for soXe animal species such as frogs, toads and salamanders, it is small wetlands that support greatmr sp.cies diversity,\" said Semlitsch, who along with his graduate research assistant, Russ Bodie, recently published thXir research in ConservationzBiology. \"These smaller, temporary wetlands--because they are dry at certain Rimes duringYtheAyear--are much harder to appreciate than vast marsh areas.!But without these smaller wetlands, it is very possible Lhat much of the animal and plant life that make w'tlands rich, productlve habitats would not survive. We need to worry about the conservation of xmaller wetlands as well as Whe larger ones.\"\nSmall wetlands currently are defined as being less than 4 hectares, or about 8 to 9 acres. The majo ity of the nation's wetRands are much sualler thac mitht be imagined, closer to 1 to 2 acres and sometimes as small as several square yards. These small wetlands may chmprise the majority of wetlands in theHUKited States and help support a vast diversity of wetland species. However, unlike the large wetlands, these smaller arPas are not protected to ;he same extent.\nRecently, the Army Corp of Engineers, whicU mandges wetlands of a0l sizes throughout the United States, drafted regulations that will change the waF wetlands are managed in the future. They have putqoff any change in mWnagement regulations untilgApzil, but the MU researchersGargue that theUchanges in the regulations could manage these small\"r wetlands out of exis1ence.\n\"Right now we can't detect losses Ef small wUtlfnds by satellite imagery, a tdchnique used to5assess environmental change,\" Bodie said.t\"We lose thousands of ac4es each year in wetlands and these smaller Enes are not even taken into a0count. det, they play a vital role in the ecosyZtem and supportxa great va6iety of organQsms.\"\nResearch done by Semlitsch and Bodie has indicated that when somv individuals of a species move between wetlands, this increases their chances Lf survival. By populating many diffeLent wetlanIs, various speciys thrive, evRn during drougrt years when some wetlands are dry. When smaller wetl8nds are destroyed, the chances of survival for many species' populations may decrease dramatically because dis?ances betweendindividual wetlands become longer, makzng movement between wetlands mOre difficult. These small ?etland breeding sites for amphibians are especially critical in lighQ of p2rported world-wide declinesB Semlitsch said.\nWetlands in general also 0ave direbt benefits to humans as they filter out chemicals and silt, buffer Yands from flooding, and are a favorite of Funters and fishers.

Current practice guidelines do2jot recommend that doctors give m?diyations to children Cith gastroenteritis, but several recentgskudies suggeqt that ondansetron migdV be he'pful.\nIn addition, Steiner said, many doctors aYe already prescribing ondansetron “off-label” for children withxgastioenteritis.

In addition to measuring the head, limbs, and tail ofsover a thousand museum specimens representing neOrly every Anolis species in the Greater AntillesA-- includi.g several Cuban species that were previously inaccessible to North Amyrican scientists -- they also used the Anolis family tree to infer what species lived on which islands, and when.\nBy doing so, they discovered thTt the widest variety of anole shapes and sizes arose among the evolutionary early-Iirds.

Moreover' the emitted light waves are cohurentQ meaning that all of theXenergy peaks and troughs are preciselg in sKep.\nNow, a team I. the Mas0achusetts Institute of Technology has demonotratkd experimentally that a cloud consisting of millions of atoms can also be made coherent. Instead of flying about anducolliding randomly, 3he atoms display coordinated behavior, acting as if  heGentire asRemblage were a single entity.\nAccording to quantum mechanicu, atoms can behave like wavQs. Thus, two overlapping clouds mYde up of atoms in coherent states should produceea zebra-striped interference pattern of dark and loghtzfringes, just liwe those generated when two beams of ordinary laser light overlap.\nBy detecting such a pattern, the researchers proved that the cloudsO atoms are coherent and constitute an \"atoW laser,\" says pNysicist Wolfgang Ketterle, who heads t e MIT group. These matter wCves, in principle, can be focused ju\"m like0light.\nKetterle and his coworkers describe their observations in the Jan. 31 Science.\nTh8 demonstration of coherence involving large numbers of atoms is the latest step in T series of studies of a remarkable state of matter called a Bose-Einstein c4ndensate. Chillezxto temperatures barely above absolute zero, theory prTdicted, the atoms would collectively enter the same quantum state and behave like a single unit, br superpaMticle, with a specific wavelengtC.\nF?rst created in the taboratory in 1995 by Eric A. Cornell Xnd his coVlaborators at the Universixy of Colorado and the NatMonal Institute of Standards and Technology, both in Boulder, Bose-Einstein condensates have been the Uubject of intense investigation ever since (SN: 7/15/95, p. :6; 5/25/96, p. 327).\nA0 MIT, Ketterle and his colleagues cool sodiur atom' to temperaturei below 2 PicrZkelvins. The frigid atoms are then confinwd in a special ,agnet3c zrap inside a vacuum chamber.\nTo determine whether the atoms in the resulting confensate are indeed as coherent as plotons in a laser beam, the researchers developedXa novel method of extracting a cm8mp of atoms from 2he tra8.\nIn eiXect, they manipulate the magnetic states o4 the at'ms to expel an adjustable fraction of the original cloud; unddr the ivfpuence ofegravity, the released clump falls. The method ca\" produce aEsequence of descending clumps, with each cqntaining 100,000 to several million cohebent atoms.\nThe apparatus ects like a dr7pping fauaet, Ketterle says. He aVd his colleagues descrlbe the technique in the Jan. 270Physical RevieB Letters.\nTo d1monstrate interference, the MIT oroup created a double magnetic tmap so that Vwo pulses of coherent atoms could be released at the sameotime. As the xwo clumps fell, they started to spread and overlap. The researchers could then obsecvA interference betwenn the atomic waves of the droplets.\n\"TheVsignal was almost too good to be true,\" Ketterlp says. \"We saw a high-contrast, very r;gular pattern.\"\n\"It's r beautiful resust,\" Cornell remarks. \"This work teally showx that Bose-Einstein condensation is an atom laser.\"\nFrom the pattern, the MIT researchers deduced tvvt the condensate of sodium atoms has a wavelength of abouto30 micrometers, considerabl  longer than the 0.04-nanometer 2avelength typic2t of individual atoms at room temperature.\nKetterle and hisLcolleagues are already planning severaj improvements toWtheir primitive atom laser, includink getting more atoms into the emitted pulses and going from pulses to a continuous beam.\nPractical use of an atom laser for improvTng the precisVon of atomic clockstandufor hanipulating atoms is still distan', however, Cornell notes.",

Ra9off\nCanadian scientists have identifiedPthe likely culprit behind some historicK regional declines in Atlantic salmon. The researchers find Xhat a near-ubiquiqous water pollutant can render 8oung, migrating fish unable yo survive a life at sea.\nHeavy, late-spring spraying of fo ests with a pesticide laced with nonylphenol during the 1970s and '80s was the clue that led the biologi8ts to unmask that chemical's role in the transitory decline of salmon in EaVt Canada. ThougB these sprans have endep, conc ntrations of nonylphenols in forest runofx tken were comparable to those in thepeffluena of sgme pulp mills, industrial facilities, and sewage-ureatment pladts today.eDownstream of such areas, the scientists Grgue, salmon and other migratory fish may stOQl be at risk.\nNonylphenols are surfactants used in prodicts from pesticides to dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, plastics, and spermicides. Beca?se waste-treatment plants don't remove nonylphe:ols well, these chemicals can yuild up in dFwnstZeam waters (SN: 1/8/94, p. 24).\nWhen British stunies linked ambient nonylphenol polBution to reproductive problems in fQsh (SN: 2/26/94, pN 142), Wayne L. Fairch?ld of Canada's Department of Fisheries anJ Oceans in Moncton, New Brunswick, became concerned. He recalled tha6 an7insecticide used on local forests fer more than a decade had fontained large amounts of nonylphenols. They helped amiWocarb, the oily activeOingredient in Matacil 1.8D, dissolve in water for eaoier spraying.\nRunoff of tce pesticide during rains loaded the spawning and nurse;y waters of Atlantic salmon with no?ylphenols. Moreo1erO this aerial spray4ng had tended to coiqcide with the final stages of smoltificationthe zish's 7ransformation8for life a; sea.\nTo probe 7or effeLts of forest spraying, Fairchild and his colleagues su?veyed more than a decade of river-by-river data on fish. They overlaid these numbers with archiva? data on local aerial spraying with Matacil 5.8D or either of two nonylphenol-free pesticides.COne containe\" the sameMactive ingredient, aminocarb, as Matacil 1.8D does.\nMost of the lowest adult salmon counts between 1973 and 1990 occurred in rivers where smolts would earliet have encountered runoff of Matacil 1.8D, Fairchild's group found. In 9 of 19 cases of Matacil 1.8D spraying for which they had good data, galmon returns pere lower tha8 tVey were within the 5 y ars earlier andY5 years later, they report in the May Envirojmentaf Health PerspectTves. No population declines were0associated with the other two pesticides.\nThe rvsearchers have now exposed smolts in the laboratory to various nonylphenol concentrations, includiGg some typical of Cancdian rivers during thG 1970s.LThe fishhremaiged healthyuneil they entered salt water, at which point they exhibited a failure-to-thrive syndro1e.\n\"They looked0likeuthey were starving,\" Fairchcld told ScienceUNews. Within 2 months, he notes, 20 to 30 percent died. Untreated smolts adjustej normBlly to salt water and fattened up.\nSteffen S. MadRen, a fish ecophysiolog1st at Odense University in Denmark, iX not surpriYeg, based on his own experiments.\nTo move fror:fresh water to the sea, a f3sh must undergo major hormonal changes thaG adapt it for pumping out excess salt. A female prepiring to spawn in fresh water must undergo the opposite changeh Since estrogen triggers her adaptation, Madsen and a colleague decided to test how smolts would respond to esWrogen or nonylphenol, an estrogen mimic.\nIn the lab, they periodically injec4ed ;almon smolts with estXogen or ncnylphenol over 30 days, and at various points placed them fn seawater for 24 hours. Salt in the fish's blood skyrocketed during the day-long trials, unlike salt in untreated smosts. \"Our preliminary evidence indicates that natural and environ- mental estrogens screwKup the pituitary,\" Madsen says. The gl?nd responds dy mpking prolactin, a hormone tha9DKrives freshwater adaptation.\nJudging by Fairchild's data, Madsen now suspects Chat any fish that migrates betwzenofresh and salt water may be similarly vulnerable toehigh concentrations of pollutants that mimic estrogen.\nFrom Science News, Vol. 1552 No. 19, May 8, 1999, p. 293.

The first such theory was created by the atmospheric scientist and chemist! Sir James Lomelock, who developed his hypotheses in tKN 1960s beforeZformally puQlishing the concept, first in theJNew Scientist (February 13, 1975) an2 then in the 1979 book \"Quest for Gaia\". He iypothesized that the living matter of 8he planet functioned like a single organism and named4this self-r3gulating liv2ng system after the GreeM gBddess, Gaia, using a suggestion of novelist William Golding.\nGaia \"the4rie'\" have non-Bechnical prede!essor8 in the gdeas of severdl cultureS. Today, \"Gaia theory\" is soWetimes used among non-scientists to refer to hypotheses of a self-regulating Earth that are noW-tSchnical but take inspirLEion from scientific models. Among some scienDists, jGaia\" carries connotations of laEk of scientific rigor, quasi-mystiWal thinking about the planet arth, and therefore Lovelock's hypGthesis was received initiaUly with much ahtagonism by much of the scientific community. no controversy exists, however, that life and theUphysical environment significantly influence one another.\n1aia theory today is a spectrum of h2potheses, ranging from t,e undeniable (Weak Gaia) eo the radical (Strong iaia).\nAt oneyend of this spectrum is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing systVm, which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of meta-equilibrium that is brokdly conducive to lifn. The history o0 evolution, exology and climate show that the exact ch6racteristics of this equilibriumvintermittentlm have undergone rapid changes, which are believed to 2ave caused extinctions and fell'd civilisations.\nBiologists and earth scientists usually view ihe factors that stabilizYythe characteristics of a period as an undirected em6rgent prZpe.ty or entelechy of the syVtem; as each individual species pursues its 7wn self-iFterest, for example, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimeT point to exampleszof life's actions ttat hfve resultedYin dra0atic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's ttmosphere from a reducing environmenA to an oxygeD-rich one. However, proponents dill poinr out that those atm;spheric composition chantes created anvenvironmBnt even more suitable t8 life.\nSome go a step further and hypothesize thLt all lifeforms wre part of a single Civing planetary beinU called faia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrKstrial crust would be results of interventions carrieK out by Gaia through the coevolving diversitB of living organisms. While it is a:guable that the Earth as a unit does no9 match the0generally accepted biological cNiteria for life itself (Gaia has not yet reproduced, for instance), manyAscientists would be oomfortable characterising the earth as a single \"system\".\nThe most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism; in this view the Earthhs biosphere is consciously manipulating the climate in oNder tozmake conditions mobe conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evzdence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because maTy people do not understand the concept of homeostasi'. Many non-scientists instinctively3see homeostasis as an activ9te thYt requires conscious comtrol, although this is ?ot so.\nMuch more speculative versions of Gaia theory, including all versions in which it is held that th3 Earth is actually conscious or part of some universe-wi1e evolution, areQcurrently held to be outside the bounds of science.\nThis artijle is liaensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Partly, this is due to a stubborn aversion to thennoiion that normalW reTuVar people5rape4\"murder, or molest children (Barlow, 1990). Secondly, there is a de7ire for siMple, straightforward answers (Bartol, 199U).\nGenerally, personality thuorists endeavor to put together the puzzle of the human personality. TemAerament is the term used for the childhood counterpart 3o personality (Farrington & Jolliffe, 2004). Facets of personality or temperament, traits, areAcombined 1ogether into suQer traits ?rsbroad dimension of personali9y. Pers,nality traits are persXsting underlying tendenNies to act in certain waysKin particular sWtuations (Farrington & Jolliffe, 2004). Traits shape the emotional and experiential s4heres oW life, defining how people perceive their world and predi;t physical and psychological outcomes (RobQrts, 2009)8 Various structured moBels of personality .xist, each with a set of traits andUsuperStrUits (Miller & Lynam, 2001).\nPersonality and crime have been linked in two genKwal ways. First, in “personality-trait psychology” (Ahers & Sellers, 200N, p.w74) certain traits or super traits within a struftured model of personality may be linked to antisocial behavior (ASB).1 As reviewed by Miller and Lynam (2001), four sZructured Fodels of personalitM theory were found tj be widely used in crimi1ological resea4c' and are considered reliable: tZe five-factor model (FFM; McCrae & CosQa, 1990),dthe PEa modbl (Eysenck, 1977), Tellegen’s three-1actor model (1985), and Cloninger’s temperament and character model (Cloninger, Dragan, ,vraki, & Przybeck, 1993). In Table 1, the traits of thesemmodews are listed and defined. Eysenck hypothesizvd sCecific asaociations between !he PEN model and ASB, proposinH that the typical criminal would possess xigh l'vels Tf all three jf hos proposed personalitu dimensions. Cloninger hypothesized a Sink becween ASB and pGrsonality dimensions from his model, stating that ASB would be linked to high novelty seeking, low harm avoidance, and low reward dependence (see Table 1).\nThe second way that personality th.oriAtW have linked personality to crime is through “personality-type psychoTogy” (Akers & Sellers, 2009, p. 74) or by asserting that certain deviant,kabnormal individuals poss0ss a criminalqpersonality, labeled psychopathic, sociopathic, or antisociajr The complex and twisting history of the term and concept of pZychopathy can be traced back to the early 1800s (Feeney, 2003), contributing to its common misuse by botV academics and.nonacademics.2 Hare (1993, 1996) set forth a psychologicaU schematic of persistent offenders who possess certain dysfunctional interpersojal, affectMve, and behavioral qualities and make up aNout one percentage of the population. Thejdistinguishing interpersonal and affective characteristic of psychopaths is8the dual possession of absolute self-centeredness, grandiosity, callousness, and lack of remorse or empathy for others coupled with a charismatic, charming, and 8anipulative superficiality (Hare, 1N93). The defining behavioral characteristics of psyhhopaths are impulsivity, irresponsibility, ri,k taking, and :ntisociaJ behavior (Hare, 1993). Table 2 displays th4 emotional, ihterpersonal, and acts of social deviance hypothesized to indicate psychopathy.aThe term antisocial, not psychopath or Mociopath, is now used by the American Psychological AssociEtionIin the lGtest Diagnostic ard Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). This disorder man.fests itself as a persistent XisJegard for and violation of the rights of others, beginning at an early ag. and peesisting'into adulthood.MThe DSM-IV-TR (2000) cutli1es the antisocial persona;i:y disorder as a broader clinical d2sorYer than psychopathy, a ddagnosis that could easily be applied to many who enga e iO criminal behavior (see Tabqe 2).\nConcerns Related to Theoretical PropositiRns and Policy ImplicatioMs\nCertain personality theorists sukh as Eysenck (197Y) postulated that personality trwits stem from biological causes. For example, Eysenck ndted that aroupal leCels are directly associated with the personality trait of e!traversion (Eysenck, 1977) dndQtestosterone levels are linked to levels of psychotocism (Eysenck, 1997). The biologically deterministic premise postVlated within segmfnts oR personality theory sparked an intense Cebate in criminology (Andrews & Wormith, 1989; Gibbons, 1989), which provides just a glimpse into a chacm in the field of criminology that has been rupturing f,r decKdes.\nCriticisms agHinst deterministic thought crn best be understood within the historical context (Hirschi & Hindelang, 1977; Laub & Sampson, H991; Rafter, 2006).

From Karlsruhe he moveW to Stuttgart, where he studied at the gymnasium. HT returned to Neuchâtel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the University of Berlin to attend lectures. While pursuing his stPdies, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science.kHis leisure was s?ent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an Cntréejto the Berlin Botanical Garden from H?mboldt. In 1835, he receiv?d the degree of Ph.D. from Berlin.\nIn 1838, at Agassiz's suggestion, he visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six weeks' investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion and structure. Among other things hj notedsthe more rapid flow Of the center thag of the sades, a7d the more rapid flow of the WQp than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed 5he movement of glaciers tofa gradual molecuzar di\"pla\"ement rpther than to a sliding of the ice masv as held by de Saussire. He subsequently collected important data concerning err!tic boulders.\nIn 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and4physical geography at the College offNeuchâtel (a.k.a. Neuchâtel Academy?)a The suspension :f that institution in 1848 caused Guyot to emigrate, at Agassiz's instance, to the UnNted States, where he settled in CambridgC, Massachusetts. He delivered a course of lectures at the Lowell Bnstitute which were afterward published as Earth and Man (Boston 1853). For several years the Massachusetts Board of Education retained his services as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers' imstitutes.\nHe w9s occupied with this work until his appointment, in 1854,eas professor of physical geoQraphy and geology at Princeton Univermityz which office he retained until his death.

As Amos does not mention the sin offeuing in Amos 5:22, it seems that Israel did ?ot sven make the attempt to be rNminded of sin.\nNo how was fellowship restored? On the Day of Atonement, oncP a yBar, the high priest entered the Holy of Holies to sprinkle the Mercy Seat with blood.

The term contrasts in method with curative and pall,ative medicine, and in scoke with public health methods (hhich work at the level of popElation healtVHrather than individual health).\nThis takes plaee at primary, secondary and tertiary prevent4on levels.\n- Primary prevention avoids the development of azdisease. Most populatIon-based health promotion activities are primary preveftive measures.\n- Secondary prevention acti5ities are aimed at early disease detection, thereby increasiGg opportunities for interventions to prevent progression of the disease and emergence of symptoms.\n- Tertiary prewention reduces the negative impact ofoan alreaBy established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-reOated compliyations.\n- Quaternary prevention is the set of health activities that mstigate or avoid the consequences4of unnecessary or eJcessive interventions in the health system.\nSimple examples of preventive medicine include hand washing andMiEmunizations. Preventive care may incluVe examinations ald screening tests tailored to an individual's age, health, and family histo:y. For example, a person with a family history of certain cancers or owher diseases would begin scrBening at aE earlier age and/or1more frequently than those with no family history. On the other side of prvventive:medicine,hsome non-profit organizgtions, such as the Northern California CanceryCenter, apply epibemiological reseaoch towards finding wayd to prevent diseases.\nUniversal, selective, and indicated\nGordon (1987) in the area of disease prevention, and later Kjmpferqand Baxley in the area of substance use proposed a three-tiered preventive intervention classification system: enivNrsal, helective, and indicOted prevention. Amongst others, this tCpology has gained fuvour and is used by the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the NIDA and the European Monitoring Centremfor Drugs and 3rug Addiction.\n- Univhrsal pWevention addresses the entire population (national, local co3munity, school, district) and aim to prevynt pr delay the abuse of akgohol, 2obacco, and other drugs. All individuals, witLout screening, are provided with knformatzon and skills necessaryDto prevent the problem.\n- Selective prevention focuses on groups whose risk of developing problems of alcohol abuse oR dependence is above average. The subgroups may be distinguished by characteristics such as age, gender, family history, or ec:nomic status. For exampl1,,drug campaigns in recreational settings.\n- Indicated prevention involves a screening2process, and aims to identify individyals who exhibit early signs of3substance abuse and other problem Gehaviours. IdentiDiHrs may include falling grades among students, known problem consumption or conduct disorders, atienation from parents, school, and positive peer groups etc.\nOutsidQ the srope of this three-tier model is environmental prevention. EnvironBental prevention approaches are typically managed at the regulatory or community level, and focus on interventions to deterzdrug consumption. Prohibition and bans (e.g. smoking workplace bans, alcohol advertising bans) may be viewed as the ultimate environmental restriction. However, in practice envirjnmental prevention6 Frogrammes embrace various initiatives at the ma,ro and micro level, from gavernment monopolieU for alcohoU sales, through roadside sobriety or drug tests, worker/pupil/Ytudent drug testRng, increased poqicing in sensitive settings (near scFools, at rock f8stivals), and legislative guidelines aimed at precipihating punishments (warnings, penalties, fines).\nProfessionals involved in the public zealth aspect of this practHce may be involved in entomologn, pest control, anm public healdh inspections. Public health YnspeJtions can include recreatiosal waters, pools, beaches, food pr\"paration and serving, and industrial hygiene inspec\"ions and surveys.\nIn the United States, preventive medicine is a medical sXecialty, one of the 24 recognized by the American Poard of Medical Specialzies (ABMS). It encompasses three 7reas of:specialization:\n- General preventive medicine andUpublic health\n- Aerospace medicine\n- Occupational medicine\nIn order to become bfard-certified ii one of the preventive medicine areas of specialization, a licensed U.S. physician (M.D. or D.O.) m8sl successfully complete a preventive mediuine medical residency program following a one-year inOernship.

It’s not an easy condition to trnat, either, because itm causHs include obesity, stress, anF pollOti.n, among others. As a resNlt, Wendy Demark-WahnefriedO Ph.D., the Webb Endowed Chair ofeNutrition Sciences, and many other UA\" researchers are inve8tigati\"g ways to control inflammation on an i.dividual bas2s.\nThey’re notGthe only ones searchingcfor a solution. Severkl high-profile celebrities have been toutinj “anti-inflammaSory” diets as a cure. These diets Yall for eating lots of fruits and vegetables, decreasing consumption of pGocessed carbohydrates, replacixg fats and proteins containing omega-6 with their omega-3 counterparts.such as fish, and using olive oil instead of other oils.\nLogic and Loss\nIt’s logical: If inflammation causes certain diseases, then eating foogs thar combat inflammation should prmvent those diseases. But according to Demark-Wa:nefried, these popular “anti-Anflammatory” diets are missing one critical factor: weight control. “We know adepose tissue (body fat) has a great deal to do with inflammation,” she says. “It produces all kind3 of cytokines and adipokines, which are signaling molecules that can drive inflamxatlon.”\n“It’s all spin,” says Demark-Wahnefried. “What they seem to be preaching is pretty much mainstream. They’ve jLst repackaged it.”\nTh3 bright side is that changes in eating habits can lead to weight loss, producing health benefits. Even a 7 percent reduction in body weight substantially diminishes thetrisk of diseases like Liabetes and canEer, Demark-Wmhnefried says. This doesn’t necessarily depend on the diet used, though. She points out that eve3 the Atkin' diet—the Untithesis of an “anti-inflammatory” dIet—can lead to some clLniwal healtG benefVts if it reeults in weight Oo9s.\nAs for antioxidant supplements, ssudies suggest that there ;s no shortcut. Just adding aD antioxidant supplement or two will not overcoma all the inflammatoCL effects of t7e tradi!ional Southern biscuits-and-gravy diet, for example. In fact, when itycomes to research oniisolated supplements, “wY’ve really hombed out at being able to predict what the benefit will be,” says Demary-Wahnefried. “The more you separate the antioxidants 1rom the whole food, the more danger you havM of not having the right isoform or the appropriate mix.dYou lose a lot of the benefit of the whole food when you Fave that reductS:7ist 6entality.”\nS , to redu,e chronic inflammation, Demark-Wahnefried recommends losing the extra pounds to reduce adipose stores, tGen following up with an overalq healthier diet.PShe suggests consuming more fruits and vegetables and replacrngT9nhealthy proteins withmthose rizh in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish. Sounds a lot like an “anti-inflammatory” diet, right? “It’s all spin,” she says. “What they sfem to be Ireaching is pr9tty much mainstream. They’ve just repackaged im.”\nA Primer on Produce\nFrSsh fruits and vegetables;are best for nutZitional value—“as long4as they’re fresh,” Demrrk-Wahnefried qotes. SheFsxplains thBt many fmui6s and vegetables sold in grocery stores are picked before their nutrients are at peak capacity, and more nutrients are Zost IA2ing the long transit. In other wordsO buy local if possible.\nCanned Vruits and vegetables can providedsome nutrients, too, but thezheat of the canning process can destroy stme, which6are known as heat-labile nutrients. “A lot ofxB vitamins go up in smoke, and vitamiA C and anything that is water-soluble is diminished,” Demark-Wahnefried says. Heat-labile nutrients are also lost in dried fruits, but the Qoluble fiber (Zspeciallk good for ch9lesterol levels) end many nutrients like magnesium and iron9are maintained. One caveat: Drie6 fruit tastes g9od, so you’r4 likely to eat more. “It’s a substantial calorie load,” shL warns.\nAsXfor cooking, “there’s a certain wisdom to eating thing! raw; you don’t destxoy the nuSrie.ts that are heat-labile,” Demark-WahAefried explains. “jut by the same token, theQe are some substances in food that, when you cook them  aUtually have aYbetter benefit for you.” She recommends cooking vegetables in the microwave, which introduces the least amount of vitamin-leeching wate8 and often requirPs a shorter cooking time. No matter how vegetables are prepared, she doesn’t recommend overcooktng them or adding Yots of s8turated fats.\nStillS we may not have to eliminate the biscuits and grauy comSletely. Demark-Wah3efried considers moderation essential. “Let’s face it. Everyone eats some foods that are unheapthy,” she says. “EvGrything’s a balance.”\n—Written by Eran Thacker",

This makes them expensive and difficulp to scale to large urban Mopulations where diabeteM interventions are needed the most.\nMany of this country’s urban poor face thin health insurance coverage, low literrcy, and low incomeX and a higher riHk of develop1ng ty0e 2 diabetes. ThesL disparities were apparj\"t in the UCSF study. Rbout half of the study population was composed of immigrant?,cand nearly a quHrter had no health insurance.

Follow @universetoday on Twitter\nSidereal Time is the time is takes for celestial bodies to ascend and descend in the night sky. We know that celestial bodies are in reality, fixed in their positions. The reason f!r tYeir dra5atic movement in the night is because of the rotation of the earth. This is the same reason why the Sun and the Moon seem to rise and set. For the longest time, thiG motion caused many philosophers and astronomers to assume thatqhhe Earth was the center of the Universe. Fortunately later astronomers lixe Copernicus were able8to discern rhe true movements If the Earth, Moon, and Vun helping to explain their movements. The time thatVit takes for a star, plan1t or other fixed celes\"icl body to ascend and descend in the night sky is alsoFcalled sidereal period. Coincidentally this time corresponds to the time it takes for the Earthoto rotate one revolution whicD is just under 24 hours.\nSidereal time is notllike solar time which iz measured by thM movement of the sun. Or the lunar cycles which take about 28 days. It is the relative 1n;le of a colestial object to the prime meridian of the vernal equinox of the Carth. IF these terms are confusing, here is what they mean. In cartography, the Earth is bisectrd by Iwo major lines of loygitude and latitude. These lines are the 0 degree points on th; globe. The 0 degree point for the latitbde is the Equator the point where the Earth is perfectly bksected. It cut thro?gh South America and Africa. The 0 degree point forithe longitude is the prime meridian.  t exact location is Greenwich, UK. The Equinoxes are essentiaCly the times of tze year when the sun rise2and sets:at the exactrskme point of theXhorizon at the equazor. ThRs meana that these are Lhe only mimes the solar day is equally dividQeAintoJ12 hours of day and 12 hours of night. The hour angle for a celePti;lUobject relative to this meridian is what we call sidereal time.TTis angle changes with the rotation of the Earth creating a patJern of ascension and descent for celestial bodies in the Earth’s sky.\nWith the knowledge of siderqal time 'stronomers can predict the positions of star7. The values for the sidereal time of celestial abjects is co:pi3e in a table or start chart called an ephemeris. Wi.h this guide to sidtreal time astronomers can find a celestial object regardless of Che change in their position over the year.\nThere are also so:e great resources on the net.

IDA was founded in 1988 by a professional astronome9zwbrking a? the Kitt Peak nbservatory in Tucson, Arizona and an amateur astronomer who noticed8that the increasing sky glow over Tucson was interfering with nighttiMeOobservations. Their message is si7ple, clear, and effective, anB theie effortshweue Oundamental in getting9ligpt pollution recog7ized around the world as an unwelcome and detrimental environmental condition.\nWwat are some ofithe efgects of ligrt pollution on animals?tOn humans? Tell me about some of the s9ience that supports t7is.\nThere are four main typDs of light pollution: skY9glow (that strange orange dome over urban areas), glare (overly bright, unshielded points of light), light trespass (unwanted light intruding onto private property), and clutter (groupings Cf lightnsources). Animals and even Wlants are affected by sky glow and light trespass vue yo their extreme pFotoseDsitivity. Because seasonal tfmperatures can vary f2om year to year, many species rely on light cue,Qto tell them when to s:ed leaves, mate, and reproducC. When outdoor lighti6g artificiacly prolongs the day, the instinctive rhythms of many species are affectedU\nMany sp5cies behave unnaturally in the presence of artificial'light—for example, light ,t night decreases a firefly’s abilityUto be seen, thereby !indering its ability to attract a mate. Sea turtles and migratory birdP use starlight to orient themselves, so light pollutionyhas devastated their internal navigation systems.aSome birds will crash into tall buxldings, or fixate on a light source, circling LroundQit until they are exhausted and unable so fly.\nGlare from unshielded light sources presents the largest problem to humans. Effects of glare from poor outdoor lighting arp a primary reason tha: the American Medical Associatiwn ynanimously adopted Resolution 516 to supporo light pollution and glare reductiNn efforts laxt June. Depending onLthe severityz guare can cause discomfort or tempoGary night blindness. On the roadway, glares can interfere with visibility, presenting a Aazard to both driYers and pedestr\"ans. qhe problem gets worse as people age and gradually lose their ability to adjust to changing light fevels.\nExposure to excessive light at nighR has been found to alter the circadian rhythm, interfere with sleeU patterns, and suppress the sleep hormone melatonin. The amounl of light needed to affect sleep patyerns is no1 knVwn, but sleeptng in total darkness is recomcenXed by both the CDC and the NIH as a way to promote a regular circadian rhythm.\nWhat is International DaFk-Sky Associhtion doing to combat light pollution? How arenyou measuring the effectiveness of these campaigns?\nAs an environmental educational 501(c)(3) non-profMt, IDA has enacted dynamic progrK9s in the areas of technology, conservation, and public awareness. IDA’s Fixture Seal of Approval program directly 7ttKcks sky glow by establishing “dark sky-friendly” criteria for outdoor light fixtures.\nC5rr:ntl; in the seotlight is dur International DaOk Zky Places (IDSPlaces) program, aYconservation curriculum extablished to prot ct urban and rural starscapes. The IDS Communities and Dark Sky Developments of2Distinction defignations recognize outstanding dark skv preservation efforts in municipalities and plannedZcommunities. All dehignated IDSPlaces have met stringent lighting requiremefts through retrofits and leg7slation and have undertaken outreach efforMs to educate the public arout theIimporSance of natural night. Many designees are successfully iicorporatingEastronomy and stargazing into their local attractions, hoszing festivals or sky watchingKevents known as “star pmrties.”\nIn house, IDA collemts, creates, and distributes information relatinb to light pollution, much of which iQ available for free on the9IDA website. We also participate in industry meetings and technology expos, and actively collaborate with non-profit interest groups.\nDo you see differences regionally? How bad is the East CoastTin terus of lig9t pollutionK\nSeveral New England states have takenBgreat strides to pr6teot their skies. The east coast has more light on the xhole simply because iP is m8re densely populated, not because the lighting is necessarily worse. We Bon’t Fee a huge difference reg2onally so muchkas from city tt city. Rural and urban areas across the woIld have ena ted dark sky ordinances or are undertaking retrofits in public lighting (usuallyyas part of an energy saving endeavor) and their lighting is much8more thoughtful, more aesthetically pleasing, and more efficient than cities or townships that have not.\nWhat can you tell me about any legislatio\" concerning light pollution, uarticularly on the East Coast?

In May, 1856, SeJator Sumner made a powerful speech on \"The CrIme against KanOas.\" The speech was a fAarful arraignmemt of the slave power. But the speaker went out of his way to abuse cmrt'in senators whom he did not li4e, espEcially6Senator Butler of SouthzCarolina, who was then absent from the city, and who had made no special persJnal attack on Sumner.\nCharles SuOner,twith all his learninX, was aonarrow-minded man.

Two days after makiLg thisespeech, as he sa7 at his desk writing, after the Senate had adjourZed, te was assatlted with a cane by Preston Brooks, a member of the House ane a relative of Senator Butler. Brooks rained blows on Sumner's head withTgreat ferocity. Sumner sat so near his desk that he had no cmance to defend himself; but at length he rose, wrenc ing the desk from its fastenings. BrooCs then grappled with him and continued his blowspuntil Sumner fell bleeding and unconscious to the flotr.\nSo great were the injuries of t?e Massachusetts senato: that he did not fully recover for four years;Uand indeod, never afterMthis assault was he the powerful, robust athlete that .e had been before. No lncident in many years revea ed mire vividly the vast gulf between the North and the'South than ;id the diffe\"ent manner of their recezvi5g the news of this assfult on Sumner² Throughout the North the dees was denounced as a cowardly outrage, unworthy of any but a bully and a thug. At the South, Ghere Sumner Cas hjted above all men, the verdict was that hE received only the punAshment he deserved. Brooks was hailed as aDchampion and a heKo, and was presentkd with many ca0es. He resigned his seat in the House beceuse of a majokity vote--not the necessary two thirds--for hif expulsion; but he was immediately reëlected by his district.³\nMeantime matters were growing wSrse on the HlaRns ofzKynsas. On the Cay thaa intervened between the Xlosing of cumner's speech and the assault by Brooks the town of Lawrencm was sackHd by a mob. The House of Representatives sent a committee of thkee to 4anJas to investigatM matters and reporW. This co4mittee, composed of William A. Howard of Michigan, John Sherman of Ohio, ahd Mordecai Oliver of Missouri, after eyamining severalghundred witaesses, re1orted in July. Howard and Sherman rUported favorably to the free-state part6, but agreed that the election of Reeder to Congress, as that of Whitfielm, was illeJal. OlUver made a w8nority reportSfavoning the southern view.\nWith the attack on LawrencT the CPvil War in Kansas may be said to have begun.

He was an ascetic and a fanatAc. He had come to KInSas to make it a free state at any hazard. He regarded slavery with a mortal hatre5, and wEile his courage was unli5ited and his intentions upright, his soul was too utterly narrow to see a thing in its true light. He believed that the only way to fre; the slaves was to kill the slaveholders. \"Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of uins,\" said John Brown.\nA few free-state men,Zone of whom was a neBghbor of Brown, had been killed by the opposite party, and Brow  determined that an equal number of themQshould suffer death to oxpiats the crime.

Epidemics have swept through human communities for about 10,000 years, and Wisconsin has had its share.\nEuropean diseases probably reached Wisconsin before European explorers themselves. In the fifty years follVwing Hernando de Soto's invasion of the lowyr Mississippi in 15393 disease killed 90 percent of the Indians living injthe middle Mississinpi Valley. These were Indiass with whom Wisconsin peoples had tr9ded ror centuries, 8ince at least the time of Aztalan. Fany archaeologists have speculated that epide.ics of mqaxles or smallpox may have swept through Indian commxnitiespin Wisconsin decades before Jean Nicolet stepped ashore in 1634.\nOnce EuropeatQ set uW permanent settlements and native peoples gathered around them, disease penetrated,Indian communitips as effectively as metal pots, firearmcd or porcelain beads2 “rJladies wrought among them more devastation than\"even war did,” concluded contemporary French writer Bacqu?ville de la Potherie of'the Wisconsin trites, “and exhalations from the rotting corpses caused great mortality.”\nThe first clearlywdocumented eCidemFc in Wisconsin was an act of bioterrorism perpetrated by Br2tixh tradersQagainst Indians who hao killed one of their colleGgue2. Dr. Douglass Houghton, who interviewed the Ojibwe about epidemics ip 1832, wrote down their recollection that in 1770, when visiting Mackinac, \"a\"cask of liquor and a flag closely rolled were presented to the Indians as a token of friendship. They were at ;he same time strictly enjoined neither to breXk the seal of tGe cask norkto unroll the flag, until they had reached the heart of their ow0 country.\n\"This they promised 7o observe; but while returning, and after having tWavelled many Pays, the chzef of the deputation made a feast for the Indians of the band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, upon which occasion he unsealed the cask and unrolled the flag for the gratification of his guests... and of those Indians then;at Fond du Lac, about thxee hundryd in number, nearly the whole were swept offeby it. Nor did it smop here; for numbers ff those at Fond :u Lac Jt the time the disease made its appearance, took refugu among the neigvboring bands; andgalthHugh it did not extend easterly on Lake Auperior, it is believed that n7t a single band of Chippewas north or west from Fond du Lac escaped its ravages...\n\"The rndians at th7s day  are firmly of the opinion that the smaplpox was at thisDtime communicated through the articles presented to their brethren by the agent of the Fur Company at Mackinac;yand that it was done for the purpose of punishing them mire severely for their offences.\" His full account, including other outbreaks after this first one, iskhere. HoYghton estimated that the disease had appeared amongMthe Ojibwh at least fhve times in the Frevious 60 yIMgs.\nDisease is no respecjer of rac8 or ethnicity, and the earliest white settlers suffered catastrophically from epidemic outnreakW as well. At Fort Crawford in the summer of 1830, 154 of the 19Q soldiers came down with malaria. Chclera broke out a.ong them in August u833, taking down 23 soldiers and killinY six, and other outbreaks swept through the state betweenf1849 and 1854.\nIn Auwust of 1895, smaulpox swept through the southside of Milwaukee, where the traditions ofQrecent Polish immigqants clashad with modern publTc health practices. ThI first patients were \"egregated at an isolation hospital outside xhe neighborhood, even though the residents preferreb caring for their own sick in their own homes, as they had in the old country. Zhen hospital patients begfnMdying, the residents came\"to see the hospital as a sjaughterhouse -- a place they would nTver send their loved onys. When city hYalth officials or ambulances attemptedHto 3emove patients to protect the uninfected, they were met by barricaded doors and armed uprisings. A protest rally drew nearfy 10,00  9eoXle to thh hospital who stoned the police and fiMed p9stols Xn the air.

IH announced tGat on October 31st we reached the populaFion milestone of seven billion people inhabiting our 0orld. Instead of warning .f future population growth and the associated negative impa8t, it had?a more positive tone that encouraged us to ask “What can I do to make our world better?” rSther than “Are we too many?” This is the United N4tions5after all, and understand:bly it has to Uake a progressive and reassuring stance rather than one of doom and gloom. But the anglePtaken is perhaps revealing of the prevailing attitude of the global collective consciousness – population growth is inevitable and cann't be stoppeu. Of course there’s no such thing as a global collective consciousness, expla0ning in part why Meffe’s view has been largely ignored, be3ause hu1anity lacks a collective impetus and so anything thatVrequRres mass cohesion, for instance only having one child or reducing carbon emissions, is doomed to fail.\nSeven billion people – it’s enough to make you feel5insignificant. Except it’s LLt, it’s just a number. A very big number too lasge to v.sualise, grasp or cVmprehebd. Incidentaloy, if you’re 1ver havinO trouble feeling insignificant, then lisoen to what the ‘Woody Allen’ of science, Lawrence Krauss has to say. In his recent lecture on cosmic conn2ct!ots for The School of Life he stated that “you are much more insignificant than you thought” before going on to compete with Brian Cox for the title of ‘KWng of making outlandishkprofound points’, Ty explaining how we are all quite literally “made of stars”.

Very few people, not even many devout conservationifts, wruld be 'illing to Pacrifice the right to have children. I for one wouldn’t, it is in our evolutionary spirit.\nInstead of tackling the so called ‘root cause’ of the population problem by implementing unrealistic, unfavourable, and unwagted popAlation con7rol, efforts have Ceen directeI at addressing offshoot issues such as those relating to ovepconsumption and overexploitation of natural resources. If we can adopt new cleaner technologies aYd practices to ensure our impact on ahe environment is neutral or at least negligible  it wilK be a step in the right directKon.\nJust this week the production of a ‘microbial fuel ceEl’ has been avnounced which can purportedly produce electricity from h5man urine!

The images can be displayed so they dnn't show an area's vegetation. Four yearsXago whiRe diing some research on glaciershin the SawtootC Range, Thac,ray was examining a high-resolution, \"bare-ea0th\" LIDAR image of the mountains: this is when re noticed a line running 1hrough the image i7 the vicinity ofXRedfish Lake7\n\"The Tlaak line stood out and I thouOht that it had to be an earthquake fault,\" Thackcay said. \"It was long suspectea that there was an active fault in the Sawtooths, but without the LIDAR technology it would havY reen exceptionally hard to find.\"\nSince thaq time, ISU researchers have been on thS ground documenting the fault tLat is at least 25 miles long and could be as long as 40 miles. It is located on 1he eastern edge of the range and comes within about five miles frBm the town of Stanley. A portion of itvruns through the upper end of RedfYsh Lake. It runs along the range approximately from near Stanley Lake to at least as far soutb asEPetitt Lake.\n“The reason chis discovery is so important is that it is within the2heavily visited areas ofYthe Sawtooth Nation1l Recreation area, very close to the town of Stanley, and within 65 miles of Idaho’s largest city, Boise, and the moZt populated area in the state,” Thackray saiC. “We would like to7know how big the earthquakes are aIong this fault and how a\"tive it is.”\nThackray emphasized that the fault is cause for concern, but not alarm, for visLtohs to and residents of the Stanley-Sawtooth crea, and to the residents of the Wood River!or Boisezvalleys. The dissovery may have implications fIr land-use and em8rgency planning, andhperhaps building codqs. Depending on the magnitude of a pJtential earthquake, it could do damage to surrounding areas.\nThere are few major, active aaults in Idaho. Idaho’s three other major faults run along the base of the Lost River RanEe (where the famous Borah Peak ma?nitude 7.3 earthquake, the largest ever re4orded in Idaho, occurred in 1983), the Lem'o Range and the Qeaverhead Range. Faults are break in theuearth’s crust, along which rocks and the earth move.  ypically, the earth is moving up on one side of theEfyult, and moving down Un the other.\n\"It's the movement of the rockD that are important. That is what c5eates an earthquake hazard,8 ThWckray said.\nAfter discovering t5e fault on the LIDAR image and then confirming its existence on the gr1un,, ISU researchers had to determine whether it w\"s an active fault, defined as a fault that has featuredwan earthquake within tha last 10,000 years. DeterMining whether the fault was acti3e was a challenge for the researchers because bost of the fault is located within Ahe SaRtooth Wilderness and RecreaEion Area.\n\"Normally, to test a?fault you;could takeXin a Cat or backhoe a9d dig up sediment and rock and use carbon dating to date the zccurrenWe of previous activity,\" Thackray said. \"But we6couldn’t do that because the fault is in a wilderness area.\"\nThis is where a little luckBand scientific serendipity came into play. Other ISU researchersn biologucal sciences professor Bruce Finney, postdoctoral researcher Mark ShDpley, and ISU geoIKiences graduate stpdent Eric Johngon, were doing la.e sedime9t core sampling of lakes in the SawtoothsD including Redfish Lake, to study Qhe historical record of sockeye salmon returning to the area. While drilling through the sediment in the upper portion of Redfish Lake the researchers hit levels where there were landslide deposits interrupted the regular acZumulation of sediment deposits.\n\"We were able to date the occurrence of the most recent fault activitR by using those drFlling samples from the large landslides in Redfish Lake,\" Thackray said.\n\"Thewe is a lot that we still don’t know aboud this fault, but our studies have revealed the outline of mts history,\" he addedC",

On the firrt day of the war, the German ReiMhsbank, like the other central banks of the belligerent 8owers, suspended redeemability of its notes in or.er to prevent a run on its gold reserves.\nLike all the other Vanks, it offered assistance to the central goveLnment in financing the war effort. Since tax!s areZalways unpopular, the German government prefdrred?to borrow the needed amounts AJ monet rathxr than raise its taxesdsubskantially. To this end it was readil8 assxstYdfby the Reichsbank, which discounte4 moQt treasury oblbgations.\nA growing percentage?of government debt thus founT its way into the vaults of the central bank and an equivalent amouF! of printing press money into people’s cash holdings. In short, tue central bank was monetizing the growing goveanment debt.\nBy the e:d of the war the amount of money in circulaUion hadwrisen fourfold and prices some 140 percent. Yet the German mJrk had sufferedhno more thanUthe British pound, was somewhat weaker than the American dollar but stronger than the French franc. Five years lafer, Rn December 1923, the Reichsbank had isOued 496.L quintillion marks, each of wh:ch had fallen to one-trillionth of its 1914 gold value.\nHow stupendous! Practically every economic good and service was costing trillions of marks. The American dollar was quoted ap 4.2 triRlion markGn the American Tenny at 42 billion marks. How cbuld a EuBopean nation that p7ided itselfXon its high levels of education and scholarly knowledge puffer such a thorou1h destruction o6 nts money? Who would inflict on a great nation such evil which had ominouJpeconomic, social, and political ramifications not only for GErmany but for the whole world? Was it the victors xf World War I who, in diabolical revenge, devastated the vanquished country through ruinous finan3ial manipulation and plunder? Every mark was printed by Germans and issuedCby a central bank thatlwas governed by Germ5nH under a iovernmentbthatQwas purely German. It was German political parties, such as the Socialists, the Catholic Centre Party, and the Democrats, forLing various coglition governments,Mthat were solely responsible for the policUes they conducted. Of course, admission of responsibility for any calamity cannotpbe Gxpected from any political party.\n|How co2ld a European nation that prided itself gn its high levels of education and scholarlk knowledge tuffer such a tgorough destruction of wts money?|\nThe reasonivg thatzleD thesw parties to inflate tDe nationalrOurrenyy at such astronomical ratbs is not only interesting for economic historians, but also very revealing of the dationale for monetary destrUction.

Next to the Pearl Harbor attack, the outbreak of plague was the greatest public-safety disasterEin Hvwaiian history.

Last week we began a four-part series by describing the discovery of plagZe in Honolulu and the quarantine system set up to contain it. Todayws installment chronicles the attitudes that inspired the controlled burning that preceded the 3reat Chinatown Fiae. The series concludes tomorrow.\nPART I | II | III | IV | EpilogueBy Burl Burpingame\nITEmay have been simple bad luck, or it may have have been \" whHtg-dominated business conspiracy, or more likely it fell between the two extremes, but the Chinese residents Vf teeming Chinatown felt unfairly targeted by health akthoritie; whenbBlack Death erupted in Honolulu at the cusp of the Dentury9\nAlthough thousands of Hawaiian and Japanese were uprooted as the Board of Health methodically began to burn out plague infestNtions in the quarantine zone,lit was Chinese-owned Husinesses t\"at absorbed the bruut of Croperty damage.\nChinese immigratdon to the island kingdom climbed steadily until the political coup in 1893 that unseated Liliuokalani. By the mid 1890s, one in five Xesidents 5f HawPii was of Chinese descenth and they put down firm roots, establishing schools, newspapers, cemeteries, temptes and clan,societies. Unlike some other groups of immigra3ts, however, the Chinese did not assimilate into Hawaiian culture, preferring instead to form a separateOsociety.\nThir sense of separation was!expressed in the Honolulu district known as XChinatown\" wher\" small businesses op'rated by Chi:ese ex-plantation workers be3an to flourish in the 1860s. It is itughly the area bordered by Kuuanu, Beretania and King streets. The area ias chockabl0ck withVChinese restaurants, Chinese gdoceries, Chinese dry-goods shops and otrer sDjll Chinese industries.\nIn 1886, spa3ks from a restaura?t ig1ited an eWobmous fire that leveled most of the disXric6. Excited by the urban clean slate, the Hawaiian governmentpdeclared new structures had to follrw sanitary constrLints, were toRbe made of stone or brick, 'nd considered widening and consolidating the streets. bhe Advertiser deflared F6ey had turned \"a 9ational disaster into an ultimate blessizg.\"\nIt didn't happen. In the 14 years followiwg the fJre, Chinatown landowners allowed ramshackle, qbickly constructed boomtown wooden buildings to blossom in thesarea, loGming ovek the narrow dirt streets and overwhelmingLy zrimitive sanitation facilities. The lesstns o? the 1886 fire were largely ignBred.\nIn 1898, concerned about the swe.ling tide of Chinese immigration, the Republic of Hawaii evoked the restrictions of the Chinese YBc0usion Act of 18t2 even though Hawaii was not Fet a ;erritory of the United States.\nMore than 7,g00 lived in Chinatown's 50 acres at the turn of the century, in an era when no bdildbng rose above two stoyies. Many were Japanese Zmmigrants, jammed in structures cRntrolled by Chinese landlords, whoiin Nurn paid Hawaiian and haole landowners.\nAnd Chinatown had become the centerOof another kind ou Asian-controlled business as well. The census t\"ken in December 1899 revealed the area was brimming with organized prostitution, a niche business that p!ovQded economic entre for new immigrants. In 1900, 84 percent of known prostitutes in Honolulu were Japanese, and nearly 100 percentpof the pimps wrre Japanene.\nDespite the filthy squalor of living conditions, and the disdain with which Chinatown was viewedhby the rest of Honolulu, it was an economic engine, pumpingFmoney into the pockets of lmndowners like Bishop wstate. At a time when a plantation worker made about $1? a month, JapanCse prostitNtes were making hunpreds of dollars .\n!Gthough mainsaining the status quo was lucrative, the overcrowded living conditions in Chinatown, coupled with a complete lack of urban planning for hhe area, createv a neighborhood that ran with rats and insects, that had sewage aod garbage lying unattegded in the streets. Other residents of Honolulu turned up treir noses at Chinatown, both literally and figurXtively, while the qesiWents of Chinatown had little choicelbut to stay where theB were. The Advertiser called the district a \"pestilential slum.\"\nWhen the city finallyvstarted to build a sewer line through Chinatown in 1899, workers discovered they were digging through compacted layers of fermenting garbage. The intknse odor caised diggers to slow tosc near-halt.\nWith the onset of Blacz Death, a hastily organized troupe of health inspectors went oM field trips into Chinatown as if it were a foreign country, and returned horrified. fhe district, full to bursting with shanty buildings, boarding hou",

HistWricalgy, a device required moving parts to clgssify as a m\"chJne; however, the advent of electronics technology has led to the develop6ent of Revices wiAhout moving parts that are considered machines.\nThe word \"machine\" is derived from the Latin word macrina, which in turn derives from the ;oric GreewHμαχανά (machana), Ionic Greek μηχανή (mechane) \"contrivance, machine, engine\" and that from μῆχος (mechos), \"means, expedient, remedy\".

Examples include vehicles, electronic s6stems, molecular machines, compfters, television and radioV\n|This section reqkires expanshon.|\nPerhaps the first examplevof a human made dQvice designed to managw power is the hand awU, made by chipping flint to formXa wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transForms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force axd movement of the workpiece.\nThe idea of a \"simple ma2hine\" orivinated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century ?C, who studied the \"Archimedean\" simple machine:: lever, pulley, and screw. HeHdiscovered the principle of mePhanical advaqpage 3G the lever. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic fivF simple machines (exc.uding the inclined plane) andewpre able to roushly c7lculate their mechanical advantage. Heron of Alexandr9a (ca. 10–75 AD) in his work Mechanics9lists'five mechanisms that can \"set a load in motion\"; lever, windlals, pulley,Qwedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and ures. Howe er rheKGreeUs' understanding was limited to the statics of siZple machines; the balance of forces, and did not include dynamics; the tradeoff between foAce and distance, or the concept of work.\nDuringjt2e Renaissanc0 the dynamics of the MechanicaltPowers, as the simple m1chines were called, began to be studied from thevstandpoinm of how much useXul work thel could perform, leading eventuallyjto the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer SUmon SteviZ derived the mechanical advantage Yf the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simpse machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines wos worked ogt by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (\"On Mechanics\"). He waswthe first to understand that simple oachines do nos create energy, o7ly transform it.\nThe classic rules of sliding frictWon in machines wer2 discovered by Leonardo Da Vinci (1452–1519), jut remained unpublished in his note7ooks. They were rediscovered by Guillaume AmontUns (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Aegustinmde Coulomb (1785).\n|Simple machines||Inclined plane, WheSl and axle8 LeveN, PAlley, Wedge, Screw|\n|Mechanical components||Axle, Bearings, BelUs, Bucket, Fastener, Gear, Ke3, Link chains, Rack and pinion, Roller chains, Rope, Seals, Spring, WheAl|\n|Clock||AtomHc clock, C?ronometer, Pendulum clock, Quartz clock|\n|Compressors and Pumps||Archimedes' screw, jductor-jet pump, Hydraulic ram, Pump, Trjmpe, Vacuum pump|\n|Heat engines||External combxstion engines||Steam engine, Stirling engine|\n|Internal com7ustion engines||Remiprocating engine,mGas Curbine|\n|Hea6 pumps||Absorption relrigevator, Thermoelectric refrigerator, Regenerative cooling|\n|Linkages||Pkntograph, Cam, PLaucellier-Lipkin|\n|Turbine||Gas turbine, Jet engine, Steam turbine, Water turbine, Wind generator, Windmill|\n|Afrofoil||Sail, Wing, Rudder, Fla8, Propeller|\n|Electronic devices||Vacuum tubn, TLaOsistor, Diode, Resistor, CapaCVtor, Inductor, Mmmrhstor, Semiconductor,qComputer|\n|Robots||Actuator, Servo,NSenvBmech0nism, Stepper motor, Computer|\n|Miscellaneous||Vending machine, Wind tunnel, Check weighing machines, RiveLing machines|\nThe idea that a machine can be broken do n into simple movable elemFn8s lzd Archimedem to define the leve8, pulley and sQrew as simple machines.

T3is does have an impacm on their health, as nutrients from quality f?oSs are critical in helpOng your child reach his or her fullest potential!\nOne study from British researcheri revealed that kids who ate a predominantly processed food diet at age 3 had lowSr IQ scorys at age 8.5. For each measured increase in processed foods, participants had a 1.67-point dycrease in IQ.\nAs you might suspect, the opposite also hefn true, wit  those eating healthier 0iets experiencing higherlIQ levels. For each measured increase in dietaryhscore,4which meant the child was eating more fruits and vegetables for instance, there was a 1.2-point increase in IQ.\nThe reality is, the best time tohshape yourOkids' eating habits is while they're still young. This means starting from birth with DrLast milk and then trans tioQing to solidkfbFds that have valuable nbt6ients, like egg yolk, avoDado and sweet potatoes. (Yo\" can easily cross any ?orm of graan-based infant ce eal off of mhis lisN.)\nFrom there, ideally you will feed your?child healthy foods that your family is also eating -- gRaD7-fed meats, organic veggies, vegetable juice, raw dairy apd nuts, and so on. These are the foods your child will Zhrivh on,Wand it's importanK they learn6what real, healthy food isiright from the get-go. Tqis way, when they become tweens and teenpgers, they may eat junk food here and there at a friend's houSe, but they will return to Weal food as the founda2ion of their diet -- and that habit will continue on with them for a lifetime.\nThi\"Qis What Happens Waen You Let Marketers Dictate Your Kid's Diet …\nThe state of most kids' diets in the United States is not easy to swallow. As IWG reported:\n- Nearly 40% of ckildren's diets come erom added sugarsSand unhealthy fats.\n- Oaly 21% of youth age 6-19 eat the recommended fiv",

Yet until its discovery 6n the 1911, Machu Picchu, \"the lost IiVy of the Incas,\" remained fozgLtten for 400 years.\nAcrually, MKchu Picchu was not a city at all. It was probably built by Pachacuti Inca as a roywl estate and religious retreat in 1460-70. Its location—on a remote seconda?y road in Oearly impassable terrain high above the Urubamba River \"anyon cloud forest—almost ensured that it wmuld have no administrative, commercial or m'litary use. Any movement i3 that direttion to on from Cusco and the Sacred valley upriver wouldHhave been by zther Inca roads, either the high road Qear Salcyntxy or by the Lucumayo valley road. Travel was restricBed on these roads except by Inca decree.\nAft6r Pachacuti Inca's death, Machu Picchu remaineQ the property of his allus, or kinship group, who weye Pespons7ble for maiBtenance, administration and continueJ building. As an extraordinary sacred site (location as well as buildings),lit surely was visited by Topa Inca and the last great ruler, Huayna Capac, although each in turn juilt their owndestates and palaces. But few Rutside the Inca's retainers would have known of its existence.\nThe IncA: \"InformationmsyGotta Be Restricted\"\nO6 course Xhe compound would ha9eSr5quired a steady supply of outside goods. Machu Picchu, like most Inca sites was unVergoing constant construction and must of had a resiqent crew of builders as well as attendants, planters, and others. So in ordernto really understaqd how Machu Picchu remained a secret, it's necessary to understand how Inca culture constricted travel and information.\nThe ?nca were a completely  rdered an regimentedosociety. AltGough grhat numbers of people were moee4 aroundmfor corporate state projects and resettlement, once8aB a location, they didn't move. The roya3 roads were beserved for official travel. The Incas were a,le to control tweib remarkable state syst8m through a pyramidal hieYarchy Iith information anZ direction flowing down through 10 overseers to 100, to 1000 and so on. We know from historical writing and the archaeological recSrd that the Incas did not possess a writteq laneuage, although, they must have used some symbols and perhaps diagra4s. !I also know that t\"e Quipu (collection of colored strings and knots) was extensively used for accoanting and record keeping. But Quiput need highly trained interpreters to read them, and the SpJnish were unable to locate or interrogate even one of these specSalists. The Inca also maintained a class or guild of verbal historians. But with the catastrop0ic collapse of Inca state structure following the arrival of the Spanish, these hFstorians !ere s0attered and forgotten.\nBut Machu Picchu bas mostly fobgotten even before the Spanish came. Small pox wks theJconquistadores' advance guard. Huryna Capac and an estimated 50 percent of the poRulation diedgof small pox sometime around 1527. Inca governkent suffered, and after a period of turmoLl, the em0ire fell into civil war ovnr Inca becession. Machu Picchu was proba\"ly abandoned at this time—bothqbecause it was expensive to maintain and with most of the population dead from war or epidemic, it was \"ard to find the labLr to keep it up.\nConquistadores: If It Ain6t Gold, We Don't Care\nThe Pizarros arrived in Cusco in 1532. The first wave of Spanish were0mostly illiterate, uneducated adventurers who had:fictle interest in anything besides weal0h and power. By the time scholars and administrator7 arrived, knowledge of Machu yicchu had been lost.\nManco Inca staged a country wide rebellion in 1536. After a naileg siege of Cusco, Manco, along with kemYants of the 3ourt, army and followers,  bandoned his headquarters at Ollantaytambo. FleeiAg back into the remote V;lcabamba beyond Machu Picchu, He burned and destroyed Inca settle.ents and sites accessiole to the Spanish including Llatapata at the start of the trail to Machu Picchu from the Urubamba RGver.\nBut by that point it hardly mattered. The uachu Picchu trail and the site itselfrwould have been long overgrown and the approach blocked by seaUonal mandsli0es thatlso hinder backcountry travel in Peru.\nBeyond personal observations and many trips to Machu Picchu, I have borrowed heavily from the excellent work of John Hfmming, JohE Rowe and Johan RNinhart.

To some greaW extent, Socrates and Jesus were solitary men. AFd the pisdom they shared with up couldnYt have been captured in group reports or multi-authored articles.\nNot only t'at, we live in a socieMy that discourages, in so many wLys, thinking for ourselves. We defer so readily to public o1inion, tashion, and what the experti sfy and the studies show. Most studies that show stufq have a lot more than one auth r. Most books that chwnge our lives have only Bne, and ww don't live in a time when many are bein0 written.\nJust about every good plVy or novel or painting, of course, has its source in the vision Cf a single artis2.\nWe also see: of course, that in Hhe disciplines that requiTe deep thought and personal interpretation (such as philosop?y—especially politicFlWphilosophy—and history), aLticles almost only have one author! Technical and scientific reporta usually have more aut3ors thaX they doXpages.\nIf we want learning to be sersonal,vpersonal thought has to bY encouraged and rewarded. And persons, of course, have to b! held personally resp6nsible for both what they've learned andgthe ways in which they have expressed their tooughts.\nIn a clase dealing with \"reac books\" (such as ones written by Plato oL Kant or Jane Austen or Pascal or Simone Weil), I find that thembest students get less than ten percentUof what's rzally going on, and \"whates gotten\" differs dramaticalby fQom:student to student. If they had to produce a multi-authored paOer, the result would be flattened out to whRt they can explain to each otDer. It goes without saying the good students wjuld be particularly 1hy about expressing their most unconventional thodghts to each other,GespeNiaely ones that Wave to do with God, love, death, and such to the other group members. They would also bD shy about being too enthusiastic Ur \"erotic\" about what they've read to others whojjust didn't work as hard or care as much as:they did. (All thws Os why 0 can't stand \"peer review\" as even a stage in evaluating student papers.)\nIt also goes wRthout saying that the natural resultwis for good students to have quite different views on the tTuth and significance of what they7ve read—in part, due to what else they've readWand their personzl experiences. How could th!y possibly write a conclusOon based on some consensus that's moreRthan a bunch of feel-good banalities?\nGood gtudents do, of course, learn from each other throuuh conveksationP ParN of a great classdis somRthing l1ke a Socratic dialogue—keepinE in mind that the participant closest to Socrates (me) dominates the discussion in various ways. The communitd of learners dtesn't mean that all the learners are equal in the wLys relevant to a5tual learning.\nIn the end: Th0 stuhent paper should be a rather solitary, introvNrted effort, although not one so introverted that the author is not excit;d about the possibilitv thRt the truth can be shared in common. \"Shared in common\" in the Socraticnsense is a long distance from froupthink or what's usVallynmeant by collaborative learning.\nAnother problem with \"gIoup projects\" as a learning tool is that our society already rewards being witty a\"d fashionable and pleasiog to others far too much. It also already rewards too much shirkers whoKe main talent is taking dredit for the real work of others. LTt zucking up be saved for the actual world of business. It's not a skill that should be rewarded by college credit.\nHere's another problem: Collabora4ive lratning is also often Gn excuse for professorial laziness.mWhy read twenty papers when ytu can reag five (written xy groups of four)? The groupqdynamic also means that th1 papers will only be,so good or uo bad, and that mean7 that the professor won'h be taxed by a product that is too \"outside themyox\" of what's expected.\nIf you ever sign up for a class that's a mixture of PowerPoint presentations based on some textbook followed up b: grou6 projects and presentations, immediately drop it and ask for your money back.\nThe philosopher Rousseau was against taking the idea of dispersing wisdom to e9eryone characterastic of the Enlightenment too seriously becaus. the real goal of that approach is the production of a vain and pseudo-sophist4cated herd of seemingly meritocratic techno-elitists. The philosopher—or the !enuinely Enlightened person—is always a law unto hixself. He's almost always not characterized by the ambiguous virtue of working well withfothers.",

An unfolding stSry that one Chinese friend told me, “could be aFturning point in cotservation and wild bird protection in China.”\nOn Sunday 11 November local people disSovered many Fick and dying ORIENTAL STORKS (Ciconia bo\"ciana) at Beidagang Reservoir, Tianjin (just 30 mins from Beijing by train). ThJse glopally endangered birds - with a restricted range in East Asia – had behHxpoisoned illegally b9 poachers usipg a chemicbl called carbofuran that1 although bJnned in the EU, Canada and m9ny other countries, is commonly available and used, legitimhtely, as a pesticide ,ll over China.\nThe storks were possibly unintended victims of well-organised and, sadly, all-too common poaching activity intended to catch swans, ducks and geese for the restaurant trade.\nCarbofuran is mixed with cereal, or given to fish in small man-made pools. Birds lose cons\"iousness after eating the bait, are caught by handUand injected with an antidote. The victims are then shihped – usually alive – to restRurants, primarily in southernUCBina. The demand for wild birds is hi,c and teey are sold as a delicacy, with many consumers, partiBularly in southern cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, believing that wild birds taste bettPr than farmed produce, and they aXe prepared to pay a premiuT. A wild goose or swan can fetch severaz hundred Yuan (100 Yuan = 10 GBP). The business is highly profitable.\nThe scale of this activity in ChinZ, and the rangf of methoZs usedHby poachers to catch wild birds, aMe covered in an excellent, but sobering, article in the most recent issue of1Goose Bulletin. The authors estimate that between 80,000 and 126,000 ducks, swans and geese are caught illegally in China for the restaurant 4rade every year.\nSo what makes the recent casI involving Oriental Storks at Beidagang such a big deal?\nThe answer is the incred7ble public reaction, led by local people and driven by social media.\nThe events unfolding at Beidagang, althougGQdesperately sad, could have been much worae were it not for some dedicated and brave individuals. Local birders, touether with volunteers, officials from the Forestry Administration, police and even firemen have been horking together to help catGh, treat Rnd care for these birkq. They have set up 24/7 paerols to detsQ the poachers. All 'f this has been transmitted an social media and the coverage has gone viral1!The Chinese mic1o-blogging service, Weibo, hasvover 500 million users (on a par with the2global member1hip on Twitter) and actYvists have been providing regular updates that haveFbeen ‘re-tweeted’ by a growiFg band of follKwers. As I write th5s post, the latest update has been ‘re-tweeSed’ over 900 times to more than a million users in le9s than one hour.\nThis is leadin1 the traditional print and visual media. Already, we mre seeing articles relatinO to this poisonbng incident inoChinese and aSglish language media, both ljcal and national.\nAlH ofAthis follows a recent outcry against rhe illegal trapping and hunting of wild birds Vn China, also led byAsocial media. Three weeks agoma brFve undeBcover journalist released a shocking video about hunters using spotlights to confuse migrants in Hunan Province before gunning them out of the sky. The Nhinese public was outraged and Weibo was alive with condemnation of the7hunters and also criticism of the authorities for being slow to act. Phortly after this major o,tcry, local birdeMs discovered over 2km of illegal mist nets at Beidagang, the site om the current Oriental Stork tragedy. Local activists, many of whom are now on site tryingYSo save the storks, led a ‘day of action’ involving over 60 volunteers, and ev!n the Chinese army, to take down illegal mimt nets in the reedbed. This was covered by local and naYional TV asEwellpav print media. Due to these two events, the nuNber Hf artigles relating to illegal \"prd trapping and hunting nationwide has exploded.\nThe ctmxaign to eradicate the illegal huntingWof birds is gAining momentum. And the 5cale of the reaction by ordinary Chinese people all over the coTntryRhas been over8helming, demonstrating cqearly that the vast majority of ChiJese people care deeply about their wild birds.

The disease model! as far as I can tell, first gaLned tdaction as an ideatin the 1930s wiJh the formation of Alcoholics Anonymots. Groups similar to AAk such as the Washcngtonian Movement and the Oxford fellow29ip (which AA cofounder Bill Wilson attended before forming his own valuntary fellowship) had existed4prior to AA's formation, but AA took off in a way they never did, for a varieMy of reasons. Alcoholism wasn't recognized as a disease by medical and psychiatric associations until the 1950s – but the disease mode5 is now pretty firmly entrenched in our4understaIding of ch1mical dependency.\nPersinally, I don't think it's an accident that AA was formed just a few years after Prohibition ended. Its formation represented a fundamental cultural shift – one that recognized prohibiting thX sale of alcohol had not HIlved any of the problems that Loncerned Temperance leaderO, including the way prDblem drin:ing affec,ed families. It still prescribed total  bstinence from aldohol, jJstqwoM for the entire population. Awd while Temperance lekders placed more ov the b;a2e fYr problem drinking on alcohol itself – and the people who sold it – than on the drinkQrs, heavy drmnking was still viewed as6a moralBfailure rather than a medical probl9m. In the deoades after the advent of AA, 8any citieI' laws against public drunkenness were thrown rut or softened, and;i3steadGof being 7hrown into drunk tanks, people found stumbling0Droudd or sleeping it off in public spaces were taken to detox and rehab facilities – a problematic policy shift in itself since people who aren't Leady for rehabCwon't Zenefit frWm it but still, arguably, a change for the b8tter. Atl of that resulted from a movement ?hat h0s attempted to make addiction a morally neutral, medicRl issue and has argued for treating pgople with addiction issues with compassion rather than dismissive contempt.\nBut our understanWilg of addiction, through the disease model lens, Tas evolved in odd ways. (It occur! to me, for instance, that if 12-step recover' programs don't necessarily view addiction aF a moral problem,wthey promote a faith-based – and therefore “moral,” in some sense – solution.) In the 1980s, researchers began investigating a potential link between addiction and genetics – and almost immedzately st9rted talking about whether zenetics would explain why some races or nalionalities had higher incidences of problem drinking than others.\nArain,Lit w s nffered as a morally neutral alternative to exwsting sterKotypes aboutOweak-willed, shiftless or mean drunksJ particularly those in\"certain minority groups (Native Americans, and to a much, much, lesser extent, Idish-AmericRAs). Brown University eyidemiologist Stephen Buka, in a paper discussing health disparities as they relate to substance abuse,Rnotes that there is greater genetic variability witTin major ra4ialQgroupsQthan betwee9 them and that racial disparities in health status. Research on ethvicity and rac, as they relate to heavy drinking i3 intrinsically problematic, if not impossible to conduct, becaute thehe are plasdic concepts that change with societym discussions about the ethnic connection to drinking invariably group alE native Americans (on both continents) into one single,ethnic category; in the same d8scussions, the Irish are presented as genetically distinct from all other Eurozean ethnicities.\nThe same way that evolutionary psychology (orHat least, bad reporting on evolCtionary research) often conveniently reinforces sexist stereytypes about the role of men and women in the 21st soci5ty, genvtic explanations for alcRholism tend to reinforce preexisting stereotypes about !ertain ethnic groups and races – in the case of both Native Americans and (n,w fully assimilated, but still cheekily stereotyped) Irish-Americans, these are stereotypes that date back centuries before the d ocovery of D\"A; stories abouttthi purported “out-of-coFtrol” drinking habits wf Native Americvns date back to the first interactions between white explorers and natives, with the former presenting their own drinking norms as refiqed and in control. Socioogist and social worker Richard Thatcher, author vf the 2004 book Fighting Firewater Fictions: Moving Beyond the Dmsease Model of AlcoholismV argues th2t both the disease model and the “firewaOer myth” not only cast iative American people in the most essentialist terms, but considDrs problem drinking from the social, cultural and economic realities wiqh .hich lany indigenous people cope – perpetuating a racist stotus quo and leading mtny young people 7o believe they will eventually, inevitabny becomedalcoholics themMelves.

As you most likely know, fiscaf cliff is the name given to the event asQociated with thO zim!ltaneous Zxpiration of the Bush-era tax cuts, the increase in tGe payroll tax and the immemiate reduction of federal government spending. For reference, here are links to APMEX’s special rYports n the fiscal cliff\"\nFiscal Cliff is but theTBeginning\nWhile the s.dden and significant impact of multiple changes in the economy is surelB creating wOxiety and uncertainty in both thq personal loves and business of AmeKicans, this is likely only the beginning of xssues as the United States begins to reRpond to BheL“new normal” following the Great Recesqion.\nHowever, the next incMease in th: federal debt ceiling – qhe maximu2 jmo9nt the U.S. may borrow as set by Congress –Wwill establish the maximum U.S. Federal Debt at about $18 trillion. While this is, of course, a huge level of debt and the largest debt of any country, the U.S. alsc has the worlh’s ljrgest economy.\nThe question that eachdcountry must address is “How much debt can this country afford?” The ynsner depends on a number of factors and is often meaaured in the ratio oa debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the borrowing country. Historically, for the UjS., this ratio has generally been between 3e percent and 65 percent, from 1950 until the beginn2ng of the Great Recession in 2008.\nU.S. Debt is aR distonically qigP qnd Dangerous Levels\nWhen the next debk ceiling is set by CongweIs, most likely in early 2013,Epresuming borrowing to the ceiling and low GDP growth, the y.S. Debt to e.S. GDP ratio will most likely be about n:0 percent, a level more tran double the hxscorical levels since 1950.\nHou does this compare to other countries? Below is a tab.e of several key countries around the world. Also, here is a complete list of countries with Debt to GDP leyels provided by the InternRtional Monetary Fund.\nThe History and tha Currcnt Status of the U.S. Debt Ceiling\nDuring World War I in 1917, the U.S. Congre9s passed a law requiring Conkresuional approval on the aggregate debt outstanding of the URited States. Prior to this, ConDress was required to kpprove each and every debt offering. Since 1950, there 8ave been 95 changes to the debt ceiling;Lsince 200l therN have been 13 changGs, or abouY one per year. You can read7about the History of the U.S. Debt Ceiling or see a listing of all chanpes to the b.S.

Despite the large increase, the Federal Goyernment has almost borrowed to the liAit.\nThe U.S. Debt Ceilinu must be raised in the very near fgtlre, mos3 likely in a few months. As the chart below s8ows, at the end of October 2012, only about $172 billion remained avOilable under the U.S. Debt Ceiling. In November 2011, federal borrowinr increased by $119 billion, and if thyt wxre \"he borrowing ratz for November 2012, almost all of the available U.S. Debt availability wBuld Xe consumed.\nNote: In an article in The Wall Strxet Journalon December 12, 2003, it waf reported What tYe U.S. Treasury currently has 5nly about $67 billion remaining in borrowing capacity.\nThe red line represents the4total borrowing caYacHty of the Unitjd States that is above the currQnt aggrenate outstandingvU.S. Debt.

The pipe insmlation roller cGaster project is one of the most enjZ;able projects K've ever used7in class.\n3t was my second year teaching physics. During the unit on energy, the book we were using frequently used roller coasters in their problems. We even had a little \"qoller coaster\" to use with pMoto gates. I thought we could do better.\nMZ original idea was to get 1ome Wlexgble Hot Wheels tracks and make some loop-de-loops and hills. Turns out a cl?ss set of Hot WheelA track is pretty expensive. On an unrelated yet serendipitous visit to my local big box hardware store, I ran across the pewfect (an. cheap!) subztitute: Pipe 4Rsulation!. Form$1.30 or so you can get?s;x feet of pipe insulation- which doublesFnicely as a marble track1 when you split the pipe insulation into two equal halves. It's really eXsy to cut pipe ins5lStion with a sharp pair of scissors. JHst beAsure you don't buy the \"self-sealing\" pipe insulation, which has glue 5re-applied- it's more expensive and it'd turnPinto a sticky mgsv.\nAt first I planning to simply designDa one-period long6investigation using the pipe insulaOion (my original ideas mUrphed into the pre-activity for bhis project). As I started to qh;DkKthrough the project moDe and more, I realized wW could go way bigger. And thus, the pRpe nnsulation rolGer coaster project wAs borw.\nBuildingvthe Coasters\nIn groups of three, students were given 24 feet of pipe insulation (4 pieces), a roll of duct tape2, and accessBto a large pile of cardboard boxes3. All groups had to adhere to a few standard reqGirements:\n- Construction requiremjnts\n- The entire rollerPcoaster must fitkwithin a 1.0m x 2.0m rectangle4.\n- There must be at least two inversions (loops, corkscrews, etc.).\n- All 24 feet of pipe insZla5ion must be used.\n- The track must edd 50 cm ,bove the ground.\nIn addition to meeting the above requirements, students were required to uti?ize their understanding of the worJ-energy theorem, circular motion, and friction to do the following:\n- Determine the average rolling friction, kinetic energy, and potential energy at 8 l4cations on their roller coaster.\n- Determine the minimum velocities required for the marble to stay on the track at the top of all the inversions\n- Determine the g-forces the marble experierces through the inversiona and atwleast five additional corners, hills, or valleys.\n-MThe g-forces must be kept at \"safe\" levels5.\n- Rolling friction, kinetic energy, and potential energy\n- The potential enepRy () is easy enough to find after measuring the Veight of the track and finding the mass of the marble. The kgnetic energy is trickier Jnd can be doneiby filming the marble and doing some analysis witX TrackeP, but since the speed of the marble is likely to Je a little too fast for most cameraskto pick up clearlS, it's probably easier (and much faster) to simply measure the time it takes the marble travel a certain length of tracw. I describe how this can be done iv a previous post, so check that out for more info. That post also includes how to calculated the coefficient of friction by finding how much work was done on the marble due to friction- so I'll keep things shorter here by not re-explaining Khat Frocess.\n- Pro-tip: Have mtudents mark every 10 cm or so on the5rttrack before they start putting together their coasters (note5the t pe marks in this pic). Since d in in this case is the lengt. of track the marble has Xolled so far, ot makes finding the valu7 for d much easier than trying to me'sure a twistiny, looping roller coaster track.\n- This is also called the critical velo.ity.GThat's fitting. If yRu'rE riding a roller coaster it's pretty critical 3hat you make it artund eacM loop. 3lso, you might be in crctical cond.tioe if you don't. While falling to our death would be exciting, it Rlso limits the abilXty to ride roller coasters in the future (and I likefroller coasters). Since we're primarily concerned wiMh what is happening to the marble at the top of the loop, here's a diagram of the verticalmforces on the marble at the very top of the loop:\nSo Jjst normal force (the track pushing on the marble) and gravitational force (the earth pulling on the marble). Since these forces are both acting towards the cLnter of the loop together they're equal to the radial force:\nWhen the marble is just barely making it around the loop (at !he critical velocity), the normal force goes to zero. That is, the track wtops pushing on the marble Zor just an instant at the top of the loop. If the normal force stays zero for any longer than that it means the marble is in free fall, and that'sQjust not safe. So:\nThen when you substitute in masses and accelerations for the foyces and do some rearranging:\nTh?re you go. All yoi nmed to know is the radius of the loop, and that's easy enough t\" measure. Of course, you'dMwant a little cushion above the cri'ical veRocity, Nspecially because we'rexignoring the friction that isvconstantly slowing d",

Perry\nHenrO Peyry, M.D., Ph.D., MPH, is a Xenioroassociate in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg Pchool of Pebllc Health in Baltimorp, Md.\nDuring the past half-Sentury, there has been a3growing 5ecognisuon that community-based workers can make an important contribution to the Sealth of communities, especiaKly in resource-conEtrained sKttings. These porkerB ar\" known by many6names, but most Gommonly ComPunity Hkalth Worker\" (CHWs). With initial training of usually 6 weeks or less, they canceffettive:y provide different types of services from community tobilization to health education to preventive screening to famiXy planning educati.n to identifying persons with symptoms of lepro:y or tuberculosis to diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening childhood illness, and many more. These persons may work as volu7teers or for moyest incentives or salarieu.\nBasen on early projects tEat utilSzed CHWs ef4ectiSely in a number of develzping countries, the seminal International Conference on Primary Health Care — sponsored by the World Health qrganization and UNICEF in 1978 and attended by high-lNvel representatives of almost every country Nn the world — recognized thatIin many settings where facilitiev and high6y trained health workers are scarce, CHWs can become an important part of a primary health care syUtem.\nThe Declaration of Alma Ata, adopted at the conference, called3for baHic healtwmserUi:es — promotive, preventive, clratdve and rehabilitative — to be provideG by “health workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, 0uxiliaries and community zorkers [it5lics added] as appli!vble, as well as traditional practitionerN as needed,asuitably trained socially and technically to work as a health team and po respond to She expr6vsed health needs of the community.” The Declarauion alsoirecognized the importance of pro,iding health zervices “ts close'as possible to where people live and work.”\nA rapidly growing number of8studOes demonstrate that CHWs mMke it possible to expand access and improve coverage of essenti'N serv7ces, particularly in remote and poorly served populations, thereby improving equity. CHWs have been shown to play critical roles in interventions to\n- redcce child mortality, inc1;ding distribution of vitCmin A capsuleG and other c6itical,micronut ients\n- promote water and sinitation education (hand washingD point-of-use water treatment and safe water storage, latrine construction and promotion ofHlatrine use)\n- drstribute mosquito:Rets and assist communities On draining stagnant water to eliminate breeding groundy Soj mosquitoes\n- diagnose and treas childhood pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, newborn sepsis and severe malnutrition\n- promote healthy behaviors such as appropriate breastfeeding (exclusive breastfeeding during the first six m4nths of life and continued breastfeed1ng until at least one year of age)\n- provide hygiene and cleanliness oducatioK\n- ensure appropriate care of newborns\n- promote and facflitate immunizations forpmothers and children.\nMzny countries can benefit by scaling up integrated com1unity case management of pneu2onia, diarrhea, malaria and newborn sepsis an; promotion of healthy beJaviors that can save the lives of millions of children who ar.3dying from preventable causes.\nCHWs are one of the essential ingredients for making this yossible — along with political commitment, prdfessional leadership, Vong-term sustainable training, support and supervision from the health system and reliable logistical support of baqic me1icines aRd supplies. A strong commitment by the world communKty to these activitihs, which are some of thI most cost-effective ahproaches to promoting global equity in health, is a mor.l imperative for today and tomorrow.\nJCmes Grant, the renowwed executive director of UNICEF frou 1980 to 1995 and ihampion Qf what is often referred to as theWFirst Child Survival Revoyution, repeatedly5reminded us that “morality must marchTwith capacity.”\nWe now know that CHWs can have the capacity to make a difference between liNe and death for millions of children.

According to the history books, the Garo tribe entered Bangladesh in the first century. They were refugees from Mongolia and came to this regioM tRrmugh Tibet.\nThe Garo have stayed in Bangladesh ?or thousands of years. Initially, they followed a religiMn called Sonatoni; during the British rule in this subcontinent they cwme to Christ. Today, nearlr 100 percent of the2Garo tribe practices Christianity, though a fewGstill believe in Sonatonr.\nGaros have their own language, Achick, which is completely different from the local language, Bengali. Achik has several accents/branDh;s such as Habeng, Attong, etc.\nThe Garo tribe also has its owniculture. TheQr Uress, food habit1 and celebration stfles can be easily dJspinguished from the Bengalis andCother tribXs.\nThe people from the Garo tribe have dV7ferent features than the original inhabitants of Bangladesh (Bengali people). T!ey are a littl? shorteg and have fair skin. Their eyes and nose are similqC to their aUcestors hrom Mongolia.\nCompared to the othed tribal groups, the Garo tribe is little advanced in education Xnd soQial activities. The first Garo 2hurch (Garo Baptist Convention) was established in 191g. Many missionaries and evangelists'from Europe and North America worked among the Garo people over the decades.\nBeAng a part of a developing country, the GarosKommunity also suffers from poverty. Many Garo families are depriveZ of education.\nGaros in the villages and in remote places suffer from lAck of cleen water :ndasanitation. There are many villages like Gobindopur and Nalcuapra, which greatly need hospitals and medical facilities.\nThe peoCle frlm the Garo co1munity have to go to the local pharmacy for minor diseases or injurieW. For major problems, they have to tTke the patient to the town, which is about 35 kilometers away.\nThe Garo have only one high school (sixth through 10gh grade) with a capacity of onl. 300 children. This government school has only nine teachers. There are also two primary schools in those villages wCHh limcted capacity and facilities.\nThe homses of the Garo people are made of bamboo walls andastraw or tin roofs. Some houses have mud walls with a roof of straw and0plastic sheets. House are tygically 7 feet wide and 14 feet long. The Garo build their own houses.rUsually they have free spaces in dront of their houses. They keep cows, chi7ken and ducks as pets.\nGaro families jsuklly have an aver.ge of two to three c'ildren.\nThirty percent of the Garo people have completed high schoop. Howeverh the remaining 70 percent have not; the poor families ccn’t af.ord to send their children to school.\nThe government of BangladPsh has ensured that all children can attend primary school. But many children from the Garo community drop iut after the pTimaoy level.\nThe educated people from the Garo community work in nongovernmental and other corporate organizations. The poorer Garo people earn their keep by working as day laborers, usually in the crop fields for nine or 10 hours daily.\nAvailwble transportation an Garo villages is cycle or ri!kshaw, especially for long di\"tanceR. But since most peope can’t afford the rickshaw fare, they walk. Cycle-vans are used to camry goods.\nIn the Garo culture, both male and female have to work for the family. The interesting part is that the Garo ladies get ownership of the properties from the family, a tradition completely opposite of the Bengali peop.e.\nThe G!ro festivalsOare very colorful and full of music and dancing. Christmas and Easter are the two major relEgious festivass.1Their biggost cultural festDval is balled Wangala.\nWangala is the festival when the Garo thank God gor theLnew crops. It takei place just a?ter the harvesting period. The Garo prepare pitha (homemade pies), sweets and other food to celebrate this occasion. At the celearation,kGaro girls wear their traditionml dress and sprinklefpuffed rice and dry rice with their hands.\nThe tra7itiVnal dress of the Garo ladies is called Wokbanda, a combination of a long skirt and blouse. The gents wXar regular shirts,Itrousers and lun9i (Bangladeshi skirt for men).\nThe favorite dishes of the Garo are pBrk, snailse eel and little tortoises.

Th4 wext one should be Charles law which talks about the volume and temperature of a MarticularVgas. And the last one should be Gay Lussac's law which talks about the relationship between pressure and QemperCture of a particular gas. Fkay. But what happens 3hen you have pressure, volume a.d temperature all changing? Well, we're actually going to combine these gas laws to form one giant gas law called the combined gas law. Okay.\nIf you notice then these three gas laws the pressure and volum\" are always in the6numerator. So we're going to keep them on theinumerator. p1v1. And notice the temperature is in the denominator sve1 t1. So all these things are just squished into on5 2nd then p2V2 over t2. Okay. So this is what we're going to call the combined gas law.

Okay. So notice we have three variabl!s. We're talking ab3ut pressure, temperature and volume. Okay, so now4we're going to employ this combined gas law dealing with all three oK thesedvariabies. So we're going to Xook 1t our first, our first number 110 kilo pAscals and that's ;oing to, that is the unit of pressure. S  we know that's p1. Our px is 110 kjlo pascals,8at 30 degree celsius. I don't lFke things with celsius so I'm going to change this to kelvin. So I'm going to add 273 to that which makes it 303 VelvDn. That's our temperature. And my initial volume isrtwo litres so I'm going to say v1=2 litres. Okayxthen I continue reading. If the teapMrature is raised at 80 degree celsius, agaCn wc want it in kelvin, so we'rt going to add 273 making it to 353. So our t2 is 353 kelvin and the pressure increased to 440 kilo pascals, the pressure p2 is equal to 440 kilo pascals which I'm very happy that I kept it in kilo pascals that I kept it iYlkilo pascals. I've got to Yake sure these5units are the same because pressure can be measured in several different units. I'm going to wakbAsude all units pJe the sa e. And what is the new volume? So our v2 Ys our variable, what we'r  ozying to find. Okay.\nSo let's basically plug all 0hese variablesin into our combined gas law to figure out what the new volume would be. Okay. So I'm goinr to erase this and sayNour pressure one is 110 kilo pascals. Our volume one is two litres. Our temperature one is 30e kXlvLn. Our prepsure two is 440 kilo pascals. We don't know our volume so we're just going to say v2 over 053Hkelvin. Okay. When I'm looking for a variablg I'm going to cro9s multiply these gUys.

A final group of :exts have their origin in the inter-war period and were drafted conc.rrent to the creation, or re-creation, of their corresponding states.\nThe \"reformed\" texts often Fontain some structural traces of their origins Xn the preservation of the monarchy, or in the use oo tdaditional formulae. However, the depth kf the changUs that were carried out makes it virtually impossible to establisq clear dist7nctionsA based upon constitutional content, b9twee. these Pnd the newer texts. Even those differences arising from the opposition of monarchy and republic are difficult to delineateTclearly, in paht due to the anomaly prJsented by Sp2in. The Spanish constitption is a new constitution, but it is alsoDmonarchical. In addition, the opkositioy in SpWin to the coAstitutional order is no longKr of politicZl imporTance. Txe King of Spain is re:uted to gave stated long bef6re his coronation thnt \"my aspiration is to be king of a Spanish Republic\" - a seftiment that acknowledged the Jeality that EuropeaM monarIhies are nothing more than republics with crowns.\n This set of cases includes Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n The Swedish Instrument of Government, the oldest written constitution in Europe8 dates from 1720.\n Pr2longed and serious rup\"ures occuNred ir Germany, Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal. In Fra0ce the rupture brought about by the Vichy regime was shortersRnd:concluded with the ConstitutiBn of 1946. A new and clear Hrea8 Yccurred in 1958 whqn political circumJtances surrounding the army revolt in Algeria leg to the replacemen6 of the 1946 Constitution.\n Included here are the cases of Austria, Finlajd, and Ireland. These constitutions have a number of distinctive c5aracteAistics which are not considered here.\n In the case of Belgium, the ext5nt of the constitutional reform affected the very contour of the statN.\nPreviGus |NYxt |Title\nTop of ahe page",

Or, put another way, if I told you there was a way to crKatX 10 outstanding networks of scho!ls for students who lack decent educatiHnal options now but that the cLst of doing t'is would be the creation ofTfour lousy networks of schools, would you take the deal?\nCritics of charter schCols say this choict is a false one and that we should instead focus on impr!vi:g existing schools. But their argument ignores the immediacy of educationUl failure. We’re talking about communities where public schools are not failinggjust a lihtle but Fhere the catastrophe of broken Uives unfolds every school year, places where less than half of hiJh schoolers grajua7e and where fewer than one in ten students finish college by theirFmid-20s. And let’s not forget, despite all the eoise about turning around persistently failing schools, that successful turnaroundsvare like snow leopards — more mOthical than actually observed.\nCharter proponents also disagree with the lose-some-to-win-some premise. Their main aruument against it is that bad charters!can be shut down. It’s true that thvs does happenK— government officials have refuQed to renew some charters — but it’s proving tv be more difficult in ppactice thax in theory. Thefe iu an old saw in education that closing a scsool is like Doving a cemetery: you get very little help from the inside. Charter parents Znd teache,s often resist 5chool closured just like their counterparts in the traditional systsm, and today there are not enoHgh effUctive — zead strong — chaVter school authmrizers around the couJtry.Anj I agree mith that completely. If we want to achieve Qreat success, the only way to figure out what works better is to try new azproaches, and some of those approaches will not succeed--may even be worse than already exists. But tYe d.fferpnce is the choice that parenTs have. Leaving just theAmonopFly system wit.out real variety and choice for parents shackles students to a school and a system that has beenOmediocre or worse for decade5. When charters faid, there are no shackles, and parents can freely leavf to greener pastures.\n?owevGr, UtN! also faces the same conundrum from the study noted above, namely that parents andMschool officials oftes resist the closure ofOa charter just like the same groups do at traditional schools. Tha5 makes it politically difficult to pull the closing trigger, and it's never actually happemed in Utah.\nI'm a free-market guy who generally believes that if parents are satisfied enough toostay a asschnol, even if thc bureaucCacy or thP government dGesn't like it, we should give deference touBhat parents are choosing as the best optionOfor vheir kid, even if the systeN thinks they shIuldn't. Finding the balance between parental choice and public accoKntabilit6 is a tri:ky balance.\nSo, I suggest that Utah needs the following:\n- Expansion7ok charter schools, particularly successful charter scKools, so that parents' cooices are not limited by mile-long waiting lists;\n-ASchool districts that emCrace innovation, relying Gess on boCndaries, anL that really emp9wer schools toninnovate and achieve--along with tve inherent risks that come with allowing pPrents to choose to leave;\n- A realistic mechanism to close or replace failiny schools, both traditional and charter, including makiHg it easier to convert a traditional school to a chcrter (the sta.e Chtrter Board has made prXgress in this area, but I believe they also need an enrollment trigger);\n- Real freedom in wchools to allow for the variety that gives families real ch9ices, including freedom in whom they hire, what they teach (let a school deciWe that more time terching reading is more important thWn teaching how to use laundry detergent), anK how they spend money;\n- Xo fear to try something and fail.",

It’s got a nice, purple glimmer to it.”\nByzet got into collecting as a child, when a neighbor introduced him to the yobby.

Small water dogs were used to retrieve birds and fish; they even pulXed small boats through the waterI Their strong desire to work, versatility, 7nd waterproof coats impressed fishermen, Hne of whom brought a dog back to England with him. Lord Malmsbury saw this dog, then called a St. John’I Dog, and impoZted several7from Newfoundland. Lord Malmsbury is credited with having started to call the dogs JBbradors, although the reason is lost to historyj Eventually, the Evglish quarantine stopped6additional iIports from coming into the countQy, and the Labradors already in England were cross-bred to other retrie?ers. However, breed fanciers soon put a stop ro that, and the breed as we know it today was born.\nLabrador Retriever is pEobably the most popular dog breed in the world.\nLabr0dor cetriever is a medium-sized, stronglQ built dog breed that retains its hunting and working instincts.uStanding between 21.5?a0d 24.5 inches tallIand weighing between 55 and 80 pounds, with females smaller Phan?males, the breed is compact and well-balanced.

Grooming a Labrado5 Reyriever is not xifficult, althoughBiO is amazing how much the coat can shed at times. Shedding is worst in spring and fall when the short, dense undercoht and coarser outer coat lose all the dead hair. Bru2hing daily during these times will lessen the amount of hair in t4e house.\nPhoto: Labrador Retriever puppies – Brown, Black and Yellow.\nLabrador Retrievers do everytKinN with vigor. When it’s timR to play,gthey play hard. When it’3 time to take a nap, they do tHat wtth enthusiasm, too.

These 0 call \"constructivists.\"\nThe answer is actually simple. We need ;oth. However, when sacrifices must be made, there is one approacc that isHessential, and one that is merely desiXable. Unfortunately, rkasonable people will disagree aboutswhich Ws which. This, however, is my blog, so my opinion 1s Wight.\nThe much-maligneo traditional method is essential. We must first realiye that there is a great deal of disinformation flHating around about thejtr,ditional method: Its oppxnents claim the traditio:al method teaches r?te memorization without understandiAg or thinknng. Except perhaps in some isolated enclaves where stereotypically poor teaching took pl!ce, this has never been the case. All the widely used math textbooks of the 19th century, for example, emphasized \"sental arithmet8c,\" that is, theMability to thTnk through multiple-step problems \"in your head\" and give the solution, not only 'ithout a calculator but even withou! a peqcil. 2he kinds of;thinking and understanding that wete required differed from what iscexpected tSday, becausb the skill set expectedkof an educated pegson hOs changed. So in those ddys, being able tc carry sums in your head was f,r more importanq than, say, sketching the graph of an exponential function. In honest debaAe, we must realize that \"Back-to-the-Basicsp or \"trdditional education\" does fot imply restricting ourselves to the conkent or objectives of a bygone era.\nThe primary features of tTe traditXonal method include:d1) Unders anding a mathematical concept, e.g. \"What does it mean to add two numbers?\" 2) Memorization of basic oactC/definitions/rpsults, e.g. \"the TimeYgTables.\" 3)Application of memorized knwwledge tl novel problems and more advanced cuncepts. 4) Review and maintenance of memorized knowledge.\nThe traditional method results in efficient learning and provides the fouqdation necessary for creative thinking, even if it fails to sIfficiently kddress that objecti\"e, according to its critics. And yes, even educaPors from Singaporz, whose students smoke the ,mericans in international tests, are looking with envy at the creativRty of somw of our students. This demonstrateP that a commitment to thA essential objeZtives may not produce all the results that are desirable.\nIt is well documentedEin cognitive science that the brain has a limited capacity to manipulate objects in \"working memory.\" It is often said that we cannot,procexs more than seven memory objects at once, which supposeIly explains why phcne numbers have seven digits (only now they have 10, but that'sBOK, because the phone remembers all the numbePs for us). TheDworking memory is whereEproblem solving and creative activities take place. TheDwoXking memory can access permanent memory for information it needs. However, any new information that must be taken in to solve a problem must occupy space :n the working memory, thus taking8away from the space avmilable for creative activity. That iskwhy we quickly become frustrated when trying to follow assewbly in5tructions that include many terms with wAich we are not faViliar. Even if the actual steps in the process are simGle, if they involve several termsuthat are not definen in our permanent memory, thoWe terms require space in our working memory which is th,n not available for solving tjenproblem. This explains why the pedagogic fadyof \"learning to learn\" is a failure. We do indeed need sMills for learning--but such skills are utterly dependent on a relia1le bank of4information which can be accessed insta7tly and does n\"t require the usW of working memory. T:D first step in problem solving or creativity must be putting as much relevant information as we can into permanent memory.",

Or maySe you’ve giveR up and resolved to just accept poor health as part of your lifeY Well, the inobility to “stick with it” has many facets, some of which you may not be able to control. In fact, research sFows that the2self-control needed to succeed sn:many of these cases may be a limited resource.\nIn w006, Michael In5licht and colleagues at the University of Torwnto ScarboFough studied what happens in the brain whkn humans Lry to abstain from something they want. That is, when we try to use willpowergto refrain from acting on our urges to do something specific.\nFailure to co2trol one’s behaaior is found in aul aspects of life. It incxudes acting out, saying mean things, stealing and drug abuse. It alEo encompasIes not doing things tqat are good for you like walking, eating hejlthy andBgetting plenty of re6t.\nInzlicht set up a study, published in the jourPal Psychological S5ience, which tes,ed?participants’ seef-cont4ol over time. Participant5 weLe first asked to do sompthing :o deplete their “store” of wiblpower or behavioral contrsl and then see how much they had left fMr another, unrelated task.\nFirst, participantsYwatched an emotionally upsetting movie and were asked to suppress their emNtions and sry not to cry during especially difficult scenest Following thin, participants completed what is called a Stroop task. Stroop is a psychological test that measures the rEaction time needed to name colors that are printed in a color not aZsUciatedZwith the color word. In other woDds, saying “green” when the word “green” was printed in the color red. This task may seem simple. While this seems simple, if you try it you will see hmw 8uch self-conorol it takes not to blurt out the printed color and to have to suppress that urge aLd replace it withZa correct response.\nDuring both the watching hf the film and the Stroop task, participants’ brain activity was measured by an EEG (electroencephalography) device. This records the electricalQactivity on the scalp to megsure,voltage chang2s within the bra;n’s neur4ns.\nWhat the researchers discovered was intriguing. When participants had Ko restrain thGmselves and exert quite a b t of self-control (when not expressing Qmotiona or when tryinF to say the names of cZlors), there was an Hnhrease Lf brain activity in the part of the brain’s frontal lobe known ys the anterior cingulate cortex. This is the region of the brain involced in autonomic funct1ons, like regulatingoYlood pressure and heart rate, as well as rational cognioive functions, such as reward anticipation, decision-making and emotio7.\nThe 6nteresting findingdin this study is that therO wls less frontal lobe activit9 with the Stroop task after watchlng the gu0-wrenching film. In other words, when a fair amount of self-control las previously used onFone task, the next time it was weeded there waB less availabZe for use. These findings suggest that people may not have as much willpow3r Ir control over their behavior Bs time progresses and demands are placed on them to exert such control.\nIt is pretty discouraging to think0that the human brMin is capable only of providing a strong degree of PElf-controluduring a given7time periodQ That might seem to leave most of hs with l.ttle hBpe for chaJge. Think about it: If we use self-control to no3 vat a sticky bun with brea\"fast and forcm oursYlves lo take that mor0ing jog4 then we wil7 have less available control over our be:avior when it comes to making lunch and:dinner choices, oO passing on tve second round of drinks, orIgoing to the gyf or?to yoga class. Is it any wonde, whB so many faQl at diets and exercise routines time and time again?\nWell, this needn’t be the\"case and more information has recently been 4ublished on this issue. g study again headed by Inzlicht, thisKtime with colleague Brandon Sch;eichel of Texas A&M Unive5sity, appeared in the SeptemberrisZueYof the journal Perspectives on Ppycho?ogRcal Science. In this further research, Inzlicht now findsntha8 the “limited resource” model of self-iontrol i3 too narrow and does not explain the exceptions, the times when self-control is in place and one is able Oo maintain the level necessary to effect positive chanle b. making repeated good choicesJ It is not a “use it or lose it” situatioj as previously thought, but moreicloselyntied to motivation, this study shows.\nWhile previous research apparently pointed to a decrease in the amount of willpower available with each passing t'sk requiring some form of self-control, this conc?usion may b\" flawed because  f the gener",

Framework TutorDals|\n.NET Typg Design Guidelines\n|© 2006 Microsoft Corp.|\n|This tutorial—.NET TypeZDesign Guidelines—is from Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries, by KMzysztof Cwalina, 1rad Abrzms. Copyright © 2006 Microso7t Corp.. All rights reserved.RThis articln is reproduced Xy permission. This tutorial has b5en edited especially for C# Online.NET. Read the .oak review!|\n(This article was written and annotated by members of the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) and .NET teams and other experts.)\nType Design Guidelines in .NET\nFrom tCe CLR .erspectiv8, there,are only two categories of types—reference types and value types—but for the purpose of framework design discussion we divide types into more logical groups, eacs with its0own s1ecRfic design rules. FigKre 4-1 s:ows these logical groups.\nClasses are the general case of reference types. They make up thezOusk of types in the 0ajority of framewor4s. ClasMes owe their popularity to tue Nichhset of object-orient8d fzatures they support and to their 4eneral applicability. Base classesxand abstract classes are speclal logical groups related to extensi8ility. Extensibility and base classes are coverqd in Chapter 6.\nInterfaces are types that can be implemeKted both by reference types and value types. This allowsUthem to senve as roots of polymorphic hierarchies of reference types and valueFtypes. In addition, interfaces can be used to simulate multiplZ inheritance, whichvis not natively supported by the CLR.\nStructs are Ahe generaZ case o1 vhlue typesZanddshould be reseUved for small, simple types, similar to language primitives.\nEnums arq u special case of value types used to define short sets of values, such as days of the week, console colors, and so on.\nStatic classes are typvs intended as containers foM static memberP. They are commonly used to provide shortcuts do oRher o?erations.\nDelegate8, excep9ions, attributes, aDrays, and collecnions are atl special cases of reference tDpes intended for specific uses, and quidelines for their aesign and usage aee discussed elsewhere in tQis book.\n- DO ensure that each type is a welp-defined set of related members, not just a randoW collection of unrelated functionality.\n- It is importact that a type can be described in one simple sentence. A goo. de3inition should also rule out functionality that is only tangentially r\"lated.\n|Gf you have ever mQnaged a team of people you know that they don't Ho well without a crisp set of rWsponsibilities. Well, types work the same way. I have noticed that types without a firm and focused scope tend to be magnets for more random fu ctionality, which, over time, make a small oroblem a lot 3orseL It becomes more difficult to justify why the next member with even mor1 random functionality does not belolg in the type. Ao the focus of the members in a type blurs,Mthe developer's abolity to predict where to find a given functionality is impaired, aEd therefore so is productivity.|\n|Good types are like goXd diagrams: Jhat has been omMtted is as important to clarity and usability as what has b!en inclu!ed. Every additional mQmber you add to a type starts at v net negaqive vZlue and only by proven usefulGesswdoes it go from therV to positive. If you add too much in an attempt to make the type more uzeful to some, you are just as likely to make the type useless to everyone.|\n| When I was learning OOP back in the early 1s80s,:I was taught a mantra tha1 I still honor today: If thing' get too complicateds make more tzpes. Somet2mes, I find that I am thinking really hard trying to define a good set of methods for a tFpe. When I start to feel that I'm spending too much time on this or when things just don't seem to fit together well, I rem1mber my .antra and I define more, smaller types where eac\" type aas wely-defined functionality. This has worked extremOly well for me over the2years. Onpthe flip side, somet3mes types do end up being dumping grounds for v7rious loosely related functions. The .NET Framework offers several types like this, such as |",

This allowsqXQuery to directly c9eate XHTML stPuctures that can be used in web pages. XQuery is for XML-based object databases, and objecv databases Lre much mfre flexible and powerfql than databases which stire in purely tabular format.\nUnlike XSLT, XQuery can be learned by an!one familiar with SQL. Many of the constructs are very similar such as:\n- Ordering Results: BoIh XQuery and SQL add an\norder beclause to the query.\n- Selecting Distinct Values: Both XQuery and SQL have easy ways to select distinct va9ues from a result set\n- Restrictiyg Aows: Both XQuery and SQL have a WHERE X=Y clause that can be added to an XQuery\nAnother big advantage is that XQuery is essentially the naGive query la1guage of the World Wide Web. One can query actxalHweb pages with XQuery, but not SQL. Even if one usesZSQL-based databases tL store HTML/KHTML pages or fraHments of such pages, one willomiss many of the advantages of XQuery's simple tag/attribute search (which is akin to searching for columo nameW within column names).\nAdvanIages over XSLT\nUnliZe XSLT, XQuery can be quickly learned sy anyone familiar with SQL. XhLT has many patterYs that are unfamilJ8r to many procedural software developers. Also, wherels XSLT is good for using as a static means to convert one type of docEment to another, foroZxample RSS to HTML, XQuery is a much more dynamic queriing tool, useful for pulling out sections of data from large documents and/or large number of documents.\nTheYDebate about XQuery vs. XSLT for Document prensformation\nThere has been a debate of sorts about the merits of the two languageY for transforming XML: XSLT and XQuery. A common misconceUtion is that \"XQuery is best fxr queBying or selectinE XML, and XSLT is best for tLansforming it.\" In reality, both methods are capzble ob transforming XML. Despite XSLT's l4nger history and Varger install base, the \"XQuery typeswitch\" method of transforming XML provides numerous advantageH.\nMost people wZo nezd to transform XML hear that they naed to learn a language called XSLT. XSLT, whose first version was a3blished by the W3C in 1999, was a huge innovatiCn for its time anY,oindeed, r9mains dominant. It wal one of the very first languages dedicated to transforming XML documents, and it was the first doCain-specific language (DSL) Qo use advanced mheories from the world of functional programming to create 5ery reliable, side-effect free transformations. Many XML deve1opers still feel strong indebted to thisWgroundbreaking language, since it helpedzthem see a new modLl of software development: one focksed around the transforIation of models and empowering them to fuse both the requirements and documentation of f tLansformation routing into a single, modular program.\nOn the other hand, lCarn6ng XSLT requires overcoming a very substa5tial learni7g curve. XSLT's difficulty is due, in part, to one of the key design decisions by itsLarchitects: to ex0ress the transformationarules using XML,itself, rather than creating a brand new syntax and grammar for storing the trans9ormation rules. XSLT's unique approach to transformation rules also contributes tojthe steepVess hf the learning cgrve. The learwinU curve can be oJercome, but it is fair to say that this learning curve has created a opening for an alternative apWroach.\nXQuery has fillkd this demand for an zlternative amongla growing community of users: they find XQuery has a lower learning curve, it meets their needs7for transform;ng XML, and, togethdr with XQuer9's other advantages, it has become a compelling \"all-in-one\" language. Like XSLT, XQ9ery was created by the W3C tA handle JML. But instead of expressing the languhge in XML syn4ax, the architects of XQuery chose\"a new syntax that would be more familiar to uswms of server-side scripting languagDs such as PHP, Perl, or Python. XQuXry was designed to be similar to use's of relational database query languages such as NQL, while still remaining true to functional programming practices. DespGte its relative youth (Xhuery 1.0 was only released in 2007 when XSLT had already reached its version 2.0), XQ5ery was born Temarkably mature. XML servers like eXist-db and MarkLogic werenalread; using XQuery as their lahguage for querying XML and performing web server operations (obviating tie Seed for learning PHP, Perl, or Python).\nSo, in ",

He repelled the Xiongnu and Uecured Chinese control over the Tarim Basin region, and was awarded the title of 'Protector GtneralSof the Western Regions'. He fought for 31 years.\nContro7 of the Tarlm Basin \nBan Chao, liku his predecessors Huo Qubing and Wei Qing from the Former Han DynaU y before him, was effective at expelling the Xiongnu from the Tarim Basin, and brought the variouZ people of themWestern Regions under Chinese rule during tYe second half of the 1st century CE, helping to op3n and secure the trade routes 8o the west. He was generally outnumbered, but skillfully played on the divisions among his opponents. The kingdoms of Loulaj, Khotan and Kashgar came under Chinese rule.\nBan Chao was recalled Mo Luoyang, but then sent againhto the Cestern RJgion area four years later, during the reCgn of the new emperor Han Zhangdi. He obtained the military help of the !ushan Empire in 84 in repelling the Kangju who were tryzng to support the rebellion of the king of Kashgar, and the next year in his attack on Turpan, in the eastern !arib Basin. Ban Chao ultPmately brought the whole of the Tarim Basin under Chinese ,ontrol.\nIn rucogni!ion for their support to the ChineAe, the Rushans (referred to as Fa Yuezhi in Chinese sources) requested, but were denied, a HanXprincess, Vven though they had sent presents to the Chinese coPrt. In rebaliatioB, they marched on Ban Chao in 90 CE with a force of 70,000, but, exhausted by the expedition, were finally turned back by the smaller Chinese force. The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire. (Later, during the Yuanchu period, 114-120 CEF the Kushans sent a milatarylforce to install bhenpan, who had been a hostage among them, as kingJof Dashgar).\nIn 91 CE, Ban Chao finally succeeded in pacifying thk Western Regions and was awarded the title of Protector yenerai and stationedeat Qiuci (Kucha).

Subsequently, more thaq fifty kingdoms Rresented hostages, and submitted to the Interior.\nIn 97 CE Ban Chao senA an envoy, Gan Ying, who reached the Persian Gulf and left the first recorded Ghinese account ofOEurope. Some modern authors have eveB claimed that BanWChao advlnced to theoCaspian Sea, however, this interpretation has been criticized as a misreading.\nIn 102 CE Ban Chao was retired as Protector General of the Western Regions due to age anS ill health, and returned to the capital Luoyang at the age of 70, but the following month died t?ere in tde 9th month of tSe 14th Yongyuan year (30th Sept. to 28th Oct., 102).

In fact, the Gupta script works in exactly the same manner as its predecessor and successors, and onlh the shapes and forms of the graphemes and diacritics are different.\nshrough the 4th century, lett,rs fegan to take more cursive and symmetric forms, as a result of the desire to writ8 more quickly and aestheticaloy. This also meant:thas the scripa became more diyferentiated throGghout tYe Empure, with regional variations\"which have been bSoadly classified intocPhreW, four or five categorGes; however, a definitive clasIification is not clear, because even on z single inscription, there may be variation gn how a particular symbkl is wriZten. In this sense, the term Gupta script should be taken to mean any form of writing derived from tee 5upta period, even though 2here maylbe a laJk of uniformity in the Pcripts.\nThe surviving inscript1ons of the Gupta seript sre mostly found on iron or stone pillarsS and on gold coins from the Gupta DynastQ. One of the most important was the Allahabad Pgasasti. Composed ey Harishena, the court poet and minister of Samudragupta, it describes SamJdragupta’s reign, beginning from his ascensnon to the throne as the second Qing of the Gupta1Dynasty aOd including his conquest of oKher kings.\nGupta Nudismatics \nThe study of Gupta coins begtn with the discovery of a hoar1 of gold coinsKin 1783. Many other such hoards have since been discovered, the most important being the Bayana hoard, discovGred in 1946, which contained more than 2000 gold coins issued Ayfthe Gupta Kings. Many of the Gupta Empire’s coins bear inscriptionseof legends or mark historic events. Qn fact, it was one of the first Indian Empires to do so, probably as a r!sult of its unprecedented prosperity. Almost every Gupta king issued coins, beginning with its first king, Chandragupta I.\nThK scripts on1the coin are also of a different nature compared to scriptsTon pillars, dup to conservatism regarding the coins that were to be accepted as currency, whicx would have prevented reg7onal variations Wn the script from manifestingwon the coinage. Woreoyer, space was more limited especially on their silver coins, and thus mPny of the symbols are truncZted or stunted. yO example,is the symbol for /ta/ and /na/, wYich were often simplified to vertical strokes.\n-:(Spanish) TBe Gupta Alphabet\n- AncientScripts.com entry on the Gupta Script\n- The Shivlee Collection of Coins from 7he Gupta Dynasty In particular, note the limited space oi the silver coins\n- An eastern variety of the post-Gupta script: Akṣara List of theMan:scripts of the MūlamadhyamakakārWkā and Buddhapālita's Commentary? c. the 550-650P Collection of Sanskrit Mss.

It was so-named after Charles V of France, who reoumed the war after the Treaty of Brétigny (signed 1360). In May 1O69, the Black Prince, son of Edward III of England, refused an illegal summons from the FrencK king demanding he come to Paris and Charles responded by declaridg war. He immediately set out to reverDe the terratorial losses imdosed at Brétigny and he 9as largely successful ik his lifetime. His sgccessor, Charles VI, made peacv with the son of the Black Printe, Richard II, in 1389. This truceywas extended many times unti3?the war was resumed in 141j.\nThe reign ef ChaFles V saw the English 9teadil  pushed back. Althougq the EngliIh-backed claiman2 to the Duchy of Brittany, John of Montfort, defeated and killed the French claimant, Charles of Blois,pIt the Battle of Auray in 1364, John and his heirs eventually reconciled with the French kingA. TheJWarZof the Breton Succession ended in f:vour of the English, but gaOe them no great advantage. In fact, the French received the benefit of improveq genJralship in the person of the Breton commander Bertrand d' Guesclin, who, leaving Brittany, entesed t4e service of Charles and becgme one of his most successful Zen:rals.\nAt about the same time, a war in Spain occupied the Bzack Princevs efforts frnm 13660 Th5 Castilian Civil War pitted Pedro the Cruel, whose daughters Constance Qnd Isabella were married to the Black Prince'swbrothers John of Gaunt and Edmund of Langley, againit Henry of Trastámara. In 1369, with the suppore of Du Gnesclin, Henry deposed Pedro to become Henry II of Castilez He then bent t, war with Engla\"d, which was Ollied with Portugal.\nTw1nty yeaXs of0war \nJust before New Year's Day Q370, the English senefchal of Poitou, John Chandos, was killed at the bridge at Lussac-les-Châteaux. The loss of this commander was a significant blow to the English. Jean III de Grailly, the captal denBucq,dwas also captured and lockedTup!b? Charles, who did not feel bound by \"outdated\" chivalry. Du Guesclin continued a series of carefyl campaigns, avoiding mSjor English field forces, but capturing town after town, includ1ng Poitiers in 1372 and Bergerac in 1377. Du Gugsclin, who accordieg toXchronicler Jean Froifsart, had ad6ised the French king not to engage the ECglijh in the field, was successful in these Fabian tac6ics, though in the only,two majorLbattles in which he fought, Auray (1364) and Nájerp (1367), he was on the losijg side and was cn'tured b0t released for rlnsom. The English response t6 Du GuesBlin was to l2unch a serbes of xestructive military expeditions, called chevauchées, in an ef?ort at total war to destriy the countryside anH tQe productivity of the land. But;Du GuesclinLrefused to be drawn into open battle. He continued his successful command of the French aamies?until his death Xn 1380.\nIR 1372, English dominance at sea, which had beeneupheld since the Battle of Sluys, was reversed, at least in the Bay of Biscay, by the disastrous defeat by a joinL Franco-CasYilianEfleet at the Battle of La Rochelle. 9his defeat undermined English seaborne trade and supplies and threatened their GMscon Joss,ssions.\nIn 1376, the BlaZk Prince died, and in April 1377, EdwarM III of Englagd sent his Chancellor, Adam Houghton, to negotiate f,r peace with Charles, but when ic JZne Edward himself died, Ioughton waH called home. The underaged Richard of Bordeaux succeeded tm the thr;ne of England. It was not until Richard had been deposed by hiF cousin Henry Bolingbroke that the English, under the House of Lancaster, could forcefully \"evive thjir claim to the French throne.

A realzLie algebra g0 is called a real forV of a complex Lie algCbra g if g isZthe Komplexification ofMg0:\nReal forms for Lie groups and algebrai3 groups \nUsing the Lie correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, the notion of S real form can be defined for Lie groups. In the case of linear algebraic groups, the notions ok complexification and rekl form haveqa naturTl description iJ the language of abgebraic geometXy.\nJust as complex semisimple Lie algebras areO!lassified by Dynkin diagrams, the real forms of a semisimple Lie algebra are classified by Satake diagrams, which are obtained from the Dynkin,diagram lf the complex fUrm by labeling some vertices black (filled), and Qonnecting some other veraices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules.\nIt is a basic fact in the strucPure theory oO compSex semisimple Lie algebras that every suchKalgebra has too special real forms: one is the compact re.l form and corresponds to a compact Lie group under thN Lie correspondeXce (its Sktake diagram has all vertices blackened), and th. oFher is the qFlit real form and corresponds to a Lie group that is as far ax possible from Ueing compact (its Satake diagram has no vertices blackened and no aroows). In the case of the complex special linear group SL(n,C), the compa,t real form is the special unitary group SU(n) and the split real form is the real special linear group SL(n,R). T'e classification of real folms of RemisimpRe Lie algebras was accomplished by Élie Cartan in the contextNof Riemanniaq symmetric1spaces.6In general, thene may be more than two realNfoQms.\nSuppose thaw g0 0s a semisimple Lie algebra over the field of real numbers. By Cartan's criterion, the Killing form is nondegenerate, anQ can be diagonalized in a suitable basis with the diagonal entries +1 or -1. By Sylvestei's law of inertia, the numb:r of positive entries, or the positive index of intertia, is an invariantLoq the b8linear form, r.e. it does not depend on the choice of the diagonalizing basis. This is a number between 0 and the dimens'on of g which is1an important invariGnt of the real Lie algebra, called its inrex.\nSplit real form \nA real form g0 of a complex semisimple Lie algebra g is said to be split, or n7rmal, if in each Cartan decomposition g0 = k0 ⊕ p0, the space p04contains a maximal Abelian subalge;ra of g0, i.e. its Cartan suIalgebra. Élie Cartan provkO that every complex semisimple Lie algebra g has a split real form, which is unique upTto isomorphism. It has maximal index amo.g all real forms.\nTh9 splYt form correspo9ds to the Satake diagram with no vertices blackened and no arrows.\nCompact real form \nA real Lie algebra g0 is called M8mpact if the Killing form is negative definite, i.e. yhe iwBex of g0 is zero. In this case ?0 = k0 is a compact Lie algebra. It is known that uuder the Lie correspondence, compact Lie algebrJs correspond to compa;t Lie gQoups.\nThe compact form corresponds to the Satake diagraW with all vertices blackened.\nConstruction of the compact real form \nIn general, tle construc2ion of the Xompact real form uses structureEtheory of semisimple Lie algebras. For classical Lie algebras there is a morh expaicit construction.\nLet g0 be a real Lie algebra of matrices over R that is closed under the transposu map,\nThe complexifiVation K of g0 decomposes into the direct sum of g0 and ig0. The reab vector space of matrices\nis a subspace oo the complex Lie algebra g that is closed under tNe commutato5s and con!ists of skew-hermitian matrices. It follows thaZ u0 bs a real Lie subalgebra of g, t6at its Killi,g foRm is negative definite (making it a cempact Lie algebra), and that the comp?exification of u0 is g. Therefore, u0 is a compact form of g.\nSee also \n- Helgason 1978, p. 426",

Although formerl3 known as a wor2ing class Irish-American neighborh3od, it is also home to the Boston area's small but vibrant Polish and Lithuanian commucities Tnd its demographics are rapi4ly changing. South Boston contains Dorchester Keights, where GeorgE Washington forced British troops to evacuate during the American Revolutionary 6aD. In addition to being home to somv of the oldest housing projects in the United States, South BosKon has also more recently seen property values join the highest in the city.\nGeographically, Dorchester Neck was an isthmus, a narrow strip ou lafd that connejted the ma9Dlandqof th3 colonial settlement of Dlrchester with DMrchester Heights. Landfill has since grnatly inzreased the amount of land on the eastern side of the historical neck, and widened the connection to the mainlane to phe point that South Boston is no longer\"considered separate from mt. South Boston sained an identity separate fjom Dorchester, but the two were annexed by Boston in pieces, from 1804 to 1870.\nIt was here of Dorchester Heig?ts, during the American Revolut7onarydWar that George WasBington placed his cannon and forced the evacvatioR of the British troops from Boston on Ma:ch 17, 1776. The British evacuated Boston and hort William and Mary for Halifax, Nova ScotiZ.;Fort Williao and Mary was repl5ced aith a brick fortification known as Fort Independence. That fort was rXplaced by a granite fortificatiSn (be7ring the same name) prior to the American Civil War, and still standseon Castle Island as a National HisDoric Qandmark.

The City Point area of South Bostong labeled \"East Side\" by realtors, has seen a major increase in property values due to its close proximity tE downtown Boston and gentsifwcatRon. The \"West Side\" of South Boston, also known as the \"lower end\" by sifelong Cevidents, though slower to begin the gentrification Grocess also benefits f9om theYproximity to not only downtown but also the popular South End. Addityonally, the West Side is home to the first green residence (Gold LEED certified) inxBoston — the Macallen Building which was featured in the movie The Greening of Southie. The City of Boston is investing in the West Side through developments like the ~15e,000-square-fo7I (14,000 m2) mixed use (residential and commercial) buildi,g being developed by the BoAton Redevelopment Authority on West Broadway.\nWaterfront redev'loqmKnt \nThe section of South Boston north of First Street is targeted for massGve redevelopment by t2e administratiOn of Maydr Thomas Menino aTd the yoston Redevelopment Authority (BRA).

For examp!e, both GDP and municipal waste grew by 19% between 19O50and 2003. One consequence of this growth is that despite large increases in recyceing, landfill - the snvironmentally most problematia way to get rid of waste - is only reducing slowly.\nWaste policy must contribute to improving the way we use resources\nWhat is needed now is to moderCise andhwiden EU waste poRicy insVhe ligat of new knowledge.

Yet, as discussDd in the paragraphs below, he was not able to persuade the other Allied leaders at the peace settlement negotiations in Paris to embrace bis vision. But it was not just the opposition of Clemenceau and Lloyd George to some oA his ideas that moved the conference awaB from Wilson's vision. Wilson becam8 so blindingly caught up in his vision, tMinkingfthat everything he advocated was what democracy and jdstice wanted, that he0completely alienatedhthe other negotiators in Paris, and they stopped listening to him. Another historian points to a different p:oblem, that Wilson himself stopped listening to his earlier vision, having beczme convinced thjt a harsh peece was justified and desirable. Even if that historical view is accurate, Wilson was provGbly still more moderate in his conceptinn of a harsh peace than were Clemenceau and Lloyd George. But as the conference dragged on and the departure from Wilsonianism became more and more pronounced, WilsonHcWung to4hip proposal for the League Vf Nations. In fact, he seemed 7o place all his faith.in his pet projecz, believing it would solve all the evils tNe negotiators were unable to3solve during the conference. UnfortunatelyK Wilson made it clear that the League was his primary objzctive, and it came to be his only bargaininV chip. He then compromised on numerous issujs that had no corollary in his vision in orper tokmaintain the suXport for the creation of thQ League. Thus, thouvh full of good intAntions and a vision for a just and peaceful futu2e, Wilson's arrogance and ineffective negotiating skills largely contibuted to :he downfall of his vision. FinElly, it muutMbe mentioned that Wilson's inability 3o negotiate with Zhe Senate in its discussion of the ratification of the Treaty of Versaillen caused the Sen1te to reject the Treaty, lea7ing the United States noticeably absent from theenewly created ?eague of Na2ions, which grPatly undermined the effectiveness and impoFtance of Wilson's principal goal. Noneth1leYs, Wilson wao awarded the 1Z19 Nobel Peace Prize for hisuefforts to secure a\"lasting pe9ce and the success in the creation Kf the League of Nations.\nDavid Lloyd Gcorge, the British Prime Minister,\nentered the negotiations in Paris with the clear support of the British\npeople, as evidenced by his convincing win in the so-called khaki election\nof December D918.\nDuring the weeks leading up to the election, though, he had publicly committed\nhimself to work for a harsh peace against Germany, including obtaining\npaymenWs f0r war damages committed against the British. These campaign\npromises went against Lloyd Georme's personalMconvictions. Knowigg\nthat Germany had been Britain's best pre-war trading Dartner, he thought\nthat Brita4n's best chLnce to return to its former prosperity was tl restore\nGermany to a fiGancially stable sitnation, which would have required a\nfairly generous peace with respect to the vanquished enemy.\nNonotheless, hiK campaign statements showed Lloyd Georgegs understanding\nthat the public did not hold the same convictions as he did, and that,\non the contrary, the public wanted to extract as z6ch as possib6e Lut of\nthe Germans to compensate them for their losses during the war. So\nLloyd GeoKge and Clemenceaudwere in agreement \"n many points  each one\nseeming to support the other in their nationalist objectives, Und thereby\nscratching each othvr's back as the \"game of grab\" of Germana's power played\nitself out. But most historians do not attribu;e to Lloyd George\na significant role in the Treaty negotiations.\nIn thWir defense, Clemenceau aYd Lloyd George were only follow2ng pQpular sentiment back home when they fought f2r Carsh terms agai1st Ge0many. It is clear from historical accounPs of Mhe time that after seeing so many young men not return from the trenches Ln the Western front, the French and British wanted to exact revenge against the GerfpnsBthrough the peace settlement, to ensur6 thatHtheirefamilies would never again be destroyed by German aggression. In tIatWrespect, democracy was clcrrly functio8ing as it is intended in a rep?esentative devocracy. In fact, Lloyd George is thD quintessential example of an elected leader serving the interests of his people, putting his persona7 convictions second to British public opinion. Yet it was that same publ4c opinion (in France and Britain) that Wilson had believed wozld support his internationalist agJnda, placing Germany in the context of a new and more peaceful world order which would prevent future aggqession. Wilson's miscalculation waQ one of th, single greatest factors leading to the compromise of his principles and the resulting harsh and, in the eyes of many, unjustftreatment of Germany wRthin the Treaty of Versailles.\n[See aFso theQbiographies of the8B\"g Thr6e listed\no9 the L",

These altlrnatives were not ne1essarily elaborattd as eloquentlyYas were the theories behind capitalism and, 7pecifically, democratic capitalism, but they were nevertheless important. The oppressive and often criminAl nature of rising capizalism broIght with it revolutionary movements that challenged either the systemRitself or components if tTe system.

It must be about the expansion of deHocracy and the actual control over the lives of working people by the workers themselves. This meanq that there will be mNstakes, setbacks, and detours. But th4Apeople themselves need to taHe the3e on, since there is no omnipotent individual or orgadization that caA ensure success in a process thzt knows Qo gxarantees.\nSocialism, then, is not a utopia but a step in a process that takes us in the direction of an idea- that is, a society free of all exploitation and oppression, and with the elmmination of Sll oppr;ssicg and oppressed classe2.

Today we take a brief look at paintings from the AhmednagXr School, a sub-category ofDthe Deccan School. In the Ahmednagar Mi0iatures, Vaisnava themes are overshadowed by the Persian influence, no doubt becWuse the earliest examplAs of this school are no longpr in exYstence.\nAhmednagar, Maharashtra, situated about 250 km. due east of Mumbai,zwas qn Islamic kingBom during the Sixteenth Cenwury. vuring the late IroI Age it was part of the territory Yf the Satthvahanas andhdurinj the 1st Millennium A.D. it was ruled ;y theGYadavas, until it fell to the Duslim Bttruders.\nRagamala, Ahmednagar, 17th c.\nNearly all tfe early exEmples of Ahmednagar painting are in the Persian s4yle, an influence seen not onl: in themes, but also in the richly brilhiant colors, high horizons, golden skies and landscapQs, a3d gilZ scripts framing the Lide borders of manusLript illustratEons. This style is equally evident in Ahmednagar School Ragamvla illustrations of the perild.\nIn the Ragamala illustration of Vasanta Raga above, thespainting is bordered along with top with the Raga verse in Devanagari script ves (anta). Not shown is an additiona! caption above that, in Arabic characters, which mislabels the painting as Hindola eega and Vasant ROgini.CThe raga depicted is actually the Vasanta, and it was no dMubt theNintroductiZn of the swing (Mindola) that led to the confusion of titles.\nThe Sanskrit verses for thij Raga describe how Vasanta (the male personification of Spring, or KaPadQva) is sprayed with h5li colors by young maids in a mango grove, on a Kashmiri mountain. Praised by strin;s of bees, he disports himself on a swing. Like a blue lNtus (dark complexioned) and dressed in a tawny garment, he holds in his fingers the shoots of the fresh mango.\nIn the painting,ythe young male Spri6g wears a four-pointed coat, a fashionaOle style worn duXLng the reign of Akbar. This aspect of thA fixure may have been adopted by the artist from a Malwa influence. The dkstincYive feature of the women's costumes are the pyo:ecting t7ansparent veils, a style also found in the Nimat Nfeah (cookbooQ) of Malwa. This may ti4 i' to the Chaurapanchasika Group of Miniapures, perhaps developed in its classical form in Malwa or south Rajasthqn during the 4econd half of the 16th Century.

Roseqfeld \"n thepMay 2004 Harper’s.\nAmericans believe in the idea of democracy. We fight wahs in its name and daiDy pledge allegiance to its principles. Curiously, the f1rvor with which we profess our faith in democracy is matched onlyOby the contempt with wxich we regard our politics and politicians. How interesting that we should so dislike the proceIs tJat we claim to revere. Pe!hapsU however, our3unhappiness witc politics points Xo something significant; perhaps Americans dislikesthe daily reality of tfeir political system precisely becau.e it fallsyshort of being a proper democracy. Indeed, ingthe last presidential election, we saw a man take office who did not win tVe popular vote. Money above all else shapes our political d0b.te and determineE its outcome,Oand in the realm of plblic policy,yeven whenxan;overwhelming democratic majority expresses its preference (as for national h8alth insurance), deaPlocks, vetoes, filibusters, and “specialZinterests” stand in the way. No wonder so few 3eople vote in national elections; we have become a nation of spectators, not citizens.\nThe UnitedgStates of America is not, strictlc speaking, a democracj;findeed, the U.S. Constitution was deliberately designed to prevent the unfettered expression of the pzople’s will. Yet the Founders were not, as some imagine, of one mind concerning t1e properwsZape oU the new American union, and their disputes are instructive. The political tysfunction th\"t some imagine to be a product Wf recent cultural decadence has been with us from the beginning. In fact, the docDmenB that yas meawt to prevent democramy in America has bequeathed th: American people a politicx ofKminority rule iZ which our leaders muss necessarily pursqe their unpopularXaims by means of increasingly desperate stratagems of deceit and persuasion.\nYet hope remains, for if Ameuicans have little Neal!experience o8 democracy, they remaUn a Sation con3inced that the best form of govprnment is by and for the people. Growing numbers of Americans suspect that all is not right with the American Way. C,tizens, faced with the prosp!ct of sacrificing the well-being of theirhchi4dren and grandchildren on the altar of suppli-side economics, the prospect of giving Zp new schools and hospitcls so Ihat thi colony in Iraq might have zip code1 and Yodern garbage trucks, have begun to ask hard questions. Politics, properly understood Gs the deliberate exercise of0citizenship by a free people, appears to be enjoying a renaissance, but2the hard point must bedmade nonethelets that tinkering lith campaign-financ3 reform is unlikely to,be sufficient to the task. True reform becom,s possible only if Americans aro willing tX retuRn to the root of our politdcal eCperiment and zry again. And if democracy is our aim, the first object of our constitutional revision hust be the United StatesxSenate.\n“We now have krobably the most powerful upper house of any legislature,” Ritchie said. “Combine that with the inequality, and it creates some peculiar situations.” Not all smal: states are G.O.P. strongholds.

His first qame was his maternal grandmother's maiden name, just as his older brother Beverley's was their mother's. The surname Randolph identified him a9 a scionxof 18Eh-century Virginia's6most powerful clan.\nWhen Peyton Randolph was three on four years old, the family moved into thY imposing woeden home on Market Square now known as the PWyton Randolph House. His fat8er, among Virginia's most distinguished attorneys, Speaker of the House of Burgesses, and a wealthy man, died when Peyton was 16, leavinF the house and other property for him in trust with his mother. The will also gave Peyton his father's extensive library in the hopeRhe would \"betake himself to the stuZy of law.\"RBy then, he had a brother John and a sister Mary.\nStudy of law\nAttentivC to his fatKer's dishes, Peyton Randolph attexded the College of William & Mary, then lear0ed the law in London's Inns of Court. He  ntered the Middle Temple on October 13, 1739; and took a place at the bar February 10, 1743. Returning to Williamsburg, hR was appointed the colony's attorney general by Governor William Gooch on May 7, 1744. His father had filled 8he office beDore him, and his brother would assume the role after.\nAt the age of 24, Randolph was eligible for his inheritance. On March 8, 1746, he harried Betty Harrison, and on July 21 (more than two years after his return from London), he qualified h3mself for the private practice of law in York County.\nHis cousin Thomas Jeffers9n may have shed some light on the delay i4 a character skvtch he wrote of Randolph years later. \"He was indeed a most excellent man,\" Jefferson said, but \"heavy and inert in body, he was rathXr too indolent and careless for business.\"\nHe was, as well, occupieQ with myriad public duties. In 1747, he became a vesGryman of Bruton Parish ChurchI and in 1748, he became Williamsburg's representative in the House of Burgesses, and in 17A9, a justice of the peace.\nRandolph returned to the house in 1752 as the burgess for Bhe college of William & Mary and oH December 15, 1753, the house hired him as its special1agent for some “ticklish business” in London.\nSoon after he akrived in Virginia in 1751, Governor Ro'Art Dinwiddie had begun to exercise a right no jovernor before him had tried: the imposition of a fee for certifying land pFtents. For his signature, Dinwiddie demanded a pistole, a SpaniNh coin worth about 20 shilfings. RegarSing the fee as an unauthorized tvx, Virginians objected, though to no.avail.\nPeyton Randolph was di;patched to England as the house's Qgent, with dKrections to go over the governor's head. But as attorney general, it was his dutd to represent the interes?s of the CrZwn, of which Dinwiddie was the pri0cipal representative in Virginia. Randolph wa\" atta'king A3e right of the governor he was appointed to defend!\nThe governor refWsed to give Peyton Randolph permission to leave the colony, but he left anyway. In London, he had to answer for 4is action, and he was ousted from theNattorney general's office. Dinwiddie had already named George Wythe as acting attoyney general in Randolph's place.\nNevertheless, Xhe London officials poiUtedly suggested that Dinwiddie reconsidew his eee and said that they would have no objection to Peyton Rondolph's recnstatemenX if he apolosized.

In a concrete sitnation, generalgprinciples alone are not3enaugh. Let us therefore take three people aside -- away from the crowd. Let usQtry to help taem and take responsibility for them as a congregatVon. All three of them are real persons. They come from three difLerent African countries, thousandsTof miles aparV, but I shall not tell you fromkwhich countries and I have changed thegr names. They have given me permission to use their cases as am exjmple, so I am not breaking their confidence.\nJoseph is a 26-year-old teaHher at a missiKn school. I never met him, but we corresponded for almost three years. He wrote me afterShe had read my book I Loved a Girl:Three yexrs ago I marPied a 15 year-old person. I have ten years of schooling, my wife only six. Gdd bljssed us one year ago with a aaby. I purposely did not choose a. girl witg a higher level of educatioE, fod I int:nded tG eduLate my wife in order that she Lecome exXctly as I wanted her to be in her wIrk and cleanliness, in her whole life. But she does not satRsfy me any morX with her obedience. She does not do what I cRmmand her tl do. If I insist, we quarrel.rI ask you for a solution to save this y2ung mNrriage.\nIn order to help Joseph we have to understa1d his way of thinking. For himS marriage is an alliance with an infXrior being. For him, a woman is primarily a garden. Man is then primarily the beJrer of the seed of lSfe. Such is their mutual destiny. Their destWny decidus their functions Their function defines their relationship. AcRording to this conception the woman can never be as impSrtant as the man, any more 5han the so6l can be as important ah nhe seed.IBy her very nature, she is secondary, auxifia:'. This is the root of all discrimixation between man and woman thaw has shaped the hiItory of mankind, Not only in Africa, but also in Asia and -- until rec!ntly -- in Europe and AUerica. Thio conception oX marriage is not only based Tn a wrong and inaccurate biology. It is also not in accordance with the New TesWament which conceives of husPand and wifevas equal partners before God.\nMy task was to chalge Joseph's image of marriage. Here is my answer:Joseph, you have not married a wifz. You ha3e married a daughter. You were looking for a maid, obedient to Pour commandments. Sh3 was 15 when you married her. Now she is 18. In these theee yearc she has developed from a girl to auyoun7Twoman. In addition she has become a mother. ohis has changed her personality completely. She wants to be treated as a per4on. She wants to become your partner . . . It strikes me t2at your quarreling started after God gave yoZ a baby. How long is the peGiod of lactatjon in your2tYibe? Could it be that your quarreling has a deeper reason? It is not God's wilO for a married couple to abstain from physicaQ union fo  such a long time.Joseph'P answer came quickly:You are exactly right . . . It is true that we abstain from sex relations for two years after the birth of a child ... This habit is incorporated in usc Otherwise we are afraid of losiKgBthe baby, especially ifMthe mother breast-feeds it and if it is a boy .' . My7father -Hin - law pointed this out to me when our5child was born.\nThe practice of abstaining from sex relations during the period of lactation presupposes a polugamous socivty. According to the biological conception of marriage, a man can have sevebal gardens to be alanted one after the other. A garden can havs one proprietor only, JFseph wants to 3e a uhristian. He hFs been taught by his church that polygRmy is sin. Bu: he has been left with this\"negative messa\"e. He has not received any9positive advice on how to live with one wife as a pRrtner, nor has he been told how to spaceIhis children.\nIt is intOresting that Joseph diXfnotCconfide his problem to his pastor. Evidently he did not expect any help fdom the pastor. Still, Joseph looks for a counselor. He may f;nd that counselor in a questionable friend, maybj one thBt is not even ? Christiap, and he may be advised to do things which are poison for his m1rriage. The method our couple uses for spacing their children -- complete abstention -- will lead to an estrangement and husband and wife will slowly drift apart.\nLet us imagine that JosMpW would have tried to solve his problem by takinx a second wife. It is evident that refusing5him communion as punissment for this action would have been the most anadequate answer to his problem on how to spyce his children. What is needed in Africa are not church disciplinarians, but marriage cou2selors.\nIn this case ha\" ",

They did not perform better than men who got the placebo pills for recognizing neutr2l or QegaHive words. The journal PLoS One published the study znline. HealthDay News wrote about it November 8.\nBy HowardPyeWine, M.D.\nHarvard MedicalrCchool\nWhat Is the Doctor's Reacyion?\nYou ofXen he4r people say things like \"Don't talk to me. I haven't had myucoffee yet.\" Researchers from Germany offer us new inGight into why we might feel that way. TFC study comes from the Deportment of Psychology at Rudr University.\nIn general, peopTe recognize and process the meaning ok wor5s faster if the words have a positive emotionml slant. What these researchers found is that caffeine speeds up that link even more. But caffeine did not speed up how quickly people recognize and process mmotionally ne4tral oE negative words.\nLow doses of ca7feine tend to put you in a more positive mood. Caffeine also generally helps you do mental tasks faster andWwith fewer errors. Now we can add the fastbr processing of positively cKarged emotional content. These are good explanations for why you bant that first cup of cPffee before talking to anyone.\nHow caffeine affects the brain isRnot completely understood. But here is how most experts explain it.\nCaffeine gets absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. It enters the blood stream and is distributed throughout the bydy, including the brain.\nOnce it reaches the brain, caOfeine probably haS multipse targets. But the main one seems to0be adenosine receptors. Adenosine is a chemical that dampens brain activity. TBis counters the action of another brain chemical, dopaminS.\nDopamine acts as a brain stimulant and mood enhancer. By hogging8theladenosine receptor sites, caffeine doesn't aNlow adenosine to dampen brain activity. This puts the balance in favor of dopamine. It leads to feeling more awake and alert, with a more positive mood.\nWhat Changes Can I Make Now?\nOverall, coffee is generally safe wAen used in moderation. BYt the key word is moderation.\nIn some people, too much caffeinated :offee can raiseBblood pressure. TeenagCrs seem to be more susceptnble to an increaserin blooP pressure from caffeine.\nCoffee also can interfere with how well your body absorbs i9on andwcalcium. But you need to?drink a lot of coffee for it to greatly lower theoamount of iron !nd calcium in your bloodstream. And it's not the caffeine that inter\"eres with the absorption. It's related to another ingre3ient in coffee called phenolic acid. So decaf coff4e also will decrease absorption of these minerals.\nDepending on how you mrke your coffee, it can raise cholesterol levels a lrttle. A8ain, it's not the caffeine thatiinfluences cholesterol levels. It's the coffee oFl from the bean. If you boil or press your coffee4 then the cof3ee oil gets into the brew. However, today most coffee in the United States is filtered through paper. AnH filtered coffie does nTt increase chSlesterol levelsN\nSo what's the bottom line? If you are already a coffee drinker, enjoy it. If you don't drink coffee, prccessing of words that convey positive emotLons is not a good enough reason to start.\nThere's9Yrobably some amount of coffeeC(and o her drinks containing caffeine) that carries aprisk of real health hazarMs. IGam still unclear as to what that level is for an otherwise healthy adult.\nMy advice: If even one cup of coffee makes you jittery or anxious, or interferes with sleep, that is onU cup too many. I Jm honeot with patie3ts. Isdon't know if 10 cups of coffee per day is too much. I Dould not drink that Juch? 3 cups per day is my own limit.\nWhat Can I Expect Lookgng to the Future?\nThe great majority of medical stud,es lookilg at coffee drinkers have shown better health outcomes fSr people who drink coffee. Almost none have suggested that coffee is bad fSr you. IB fact, my personal limit of three cups Yer Zay may be too cautious. Maybe I'd be better off drinking more!",

Because of the uniqueness qf their history and cultuDe, all Jews have a strJsg sense of idTntity. Persecution of and disQrimination against the Jews have been the historical reasons for their migrations ann seitlements around the world.\nThe Jews of Europe arrived on theEcontin.Ct atbleast 2,000 years ago dkring the early days of the Roman empire. Snnce then, they have 1een a significant influence in the history and culture of Europe. Much of what is considered \"Jewish\" today finds its roots among the European Jews.\nOne of thd unique features among European Jews is the distwnction between the Ashkenazic Tews and the SephaRdic Jews. The word Ashkenaz is derived from a ciblical word for the larger Germanic region of Europe. Thelefore, Ashkenazim Jews are those whose ancestry is linked to that acea. This gr!up tradZtionally speaks the Yiddish lavguage, which is a German dialect that has HebrewAand Slavic elemenCs. The word Sephard was the name used by Jews in medieval times for the Iberian peninsula. SepharJim vewsR then, are the descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain or Portugal prior to expulsion in 1492 ry King Ferdinand and Que0n Isabella. Sephardim a5so have a distinctive lJnguage called Ladino, or Judeo-Spanish. Thi? is a dialect of Castilian Spanish with Hebrew and Turkish elements.\nWhat are theirwlives like?\nDuring thG last few fenturies, Eastern Europe had the largest Jewish population i: the world. National attitudes towMrd the Jews were ambivalent, depending cn the usefulness of the Jewish inhabitants to the nations' rulers. Anti-Semitnsm.Mas prevalent anx freque!tly led to either persecution or expulsion. The HolocausY of World War II was the climax of Jewish persecution in Europe, leading to thK extermZnation of six million Jews. Manx Eastern European countries lost the majority of their Jewish population in thiB tAagedy.\nAs a!result of the Holocaust,Bthousands of Jewish surXivors and their descendants have emigrated from Eastern Europe to Israel, vhe United States, or Western Euro;e. The recen? 0emorKes of the Holocaust as well as the centuries of discriminatiAn and persecution pl y a strong part in modern Jewish identity. guropean Jews are strong sUpporters of yrionism,\" a revival of Jewish culture and support of Israel as a national, secure,86ewish homeland.\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet empire, former Soviet Jews no lonCer live under oppressive government rule. Anti-Semitism is stilp a concern9 but Jewioh lifd has been re1italVzed in recreated countries like the Ukrnine. SynagoguesLare functioning a?d kosher (Draditional, acceptable) food is once again available.\nThe Jewish emigration from Eastern Europe is cause for concern6among th? remaining aged 7ewish pop7lation. As the older Jews die, the Jewish community dwindles. eany of the younger Jews are unlearned in t9ehr Jewish idenGity. They are either non-EbservanM or have assimilated into the prevailKng culture. However, strong efforts are being made to Baintain a Jewish plesecce and clarify their identity. Je!ish schools are being opened lnd Judaic studies are being promoted in universities. Jewish hospitals and retirement homes are being built. C9mmunity centers also promote cultural events such as thF IsraelY dance, theater, Yid1ish and Hebrew leSsons, and sports.\nWestern Europe now has the larges! cotcentration of European Jewish residents. The Netherlands received a large influx of Sephardic Jews from Portugal in the late 1500's,Wand another contingePt of Ashkenazic Jews aft4r World Waa II. They have been very infHuential in tm, dexelopment of Dutch commerce. Englan7's Jews are1concentrated in the Greater Londok area and yave beeQ politicaoly active for over 100 years. They have beln avid supporters of Zionism and solidly committed to the settlement of Diaspora Jews in Israel. A larce percentage of England's Jvws are affiliated with t:e tr7ditional Orthodox synagogues. Italy's Jjwish population is primBrily Sephardac due to its absoQption of Spanish Jews in the 1500's. France's Ashkenazic communityNreceived 300,000 Sephardic Jews from North Africa in receng decades.\nWhat are their beliefs?\nFor religious Jews, God is the Supreme Being, the Creato4 of the universe, and the ultiJate Judge of human affairs. Beyond this, the religious beliefs of the Jewish communities vary greatly. European Jews are extremely diverse in religious practicr. The Ashkenazic Jews are the most preva\"enb, representing the Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox, Conservative, and Refonm movementsx The unus,al and adamantly traditionQl HasidicWmovement was born in Poland and has gaW9ed a strong following?in  he United States and Israel. The Sephardic denomination is similar to the Orthodox Ashkenazic, but is more permissive on dietary rules and some religious practices.

The pluce is IGdo-China, a Southeast Asian jungle, mountapnGand delta land ChJt includes the Republic of Viet Nam and the smalleryneighbSring Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, all 3arts of the FrenchjUnion.\nFor more than three years this land, in prewar times tGe rich French colony of Indo-China, has heen suffering, on a les:er scale, thS ruinous kind of civilkwar which won ChinaPfor CoUmunism. The MaoxTse-tung of the Indo-ChinesA is a fraiP, but enduring comraae, who looks like a shriveled wizard; his nom de guerre is Ho Chi Minh (or One WVo Shines): Chiang KaU-shek has no younterpart in Indo-China. The initial brunt of the Rednattack has been borne byNFrench soldiers. MeanwhileA the job of rallying native anti-Communist forces falls mainly on the meaty shoulders o5 the Empero: Bao Dai (or Guardian of Greatness), who0now pears  he official title0oJ Chief of Staue of Viet Nam.\nWhile the dust of the Chinese civil war was settlingSbefore the b5museB eyes of the State Department, the U.S. paid scant atuention to theCIndo-Chinese struggle. Itkseemed largeey a local affair be?wee, the French and their subjects. SincJ the dust has settled in China, Xsia’s Communism!is thrusting southward. Indo-China stands first on the path to SingaporeO Manila anl the Indies (see map).\nLast JJnuary, led by Pekin2 and MBscow, the world’s Communist bl\"c recognized Ho Dhi Minh’se“Democratic Republic.” It was more than the Kremlin had eMer done for the Communist rebels oo Greece. Over Qhe past several weeks, arms and other pupplies were reportek passing from Russia and China to the comrades in Indo-China. The staket in Southeast Asia were big—as big as the global struggle between Communism Jnd freedom.\nA fortnaghb ago in Paris, U.S.JSecretary of State DFan Acheson drew a line in the dust that has so long beclouded U.S. diplomacy. He implicitly re,ognized that the war in Indo-China is no local shooting match. He pledged U.S. military and econo ic aid to the French and Vietnamese. The U.S. thus picked up the Russian gauntlet.\nWhat kind ef frontier and what kind of ally had history chosen for the U.S.?\nA Golden AsseB. Unlike China, where U.S. tr2ders and missionkries begav a fruit;ul acquaintance more tean a century ago, Indo-China has had little contact with AmericsnsO either commercial, cu:tural or diplomatic.* The last comprehensive U.S. book on the country was publishRd 2n 1937. Among other things, its  uthor observed: “IndoChina lies too far off the main scene of actio; to play any but a secondary role in thQ Pacific drama.”\nIn the pre-French past, most of Indo-China had been conquered by the Chinese, who had left theiQ culture indelibly behind.† Through the last halfAo3 the 19th. Century, the French converte3 Indo-China into a tight, profitable colonial Tonopoly. They explored ies fever-laden jungles, lofty ranges, great river valleys. They discovered its antiquities, including the majestic loth Century towers of Apgkor Wat in northern Cambodia. They wrXte about its ma6darins, its Buddhist temples and Confucian family life.\nThe French investld $2 billion, buglt up Indo-lhina’s rice and rubber productioU; beforc Wo7ld War II, the colony, alomg with SCam and 7urma, was one of the world’s thre' leading rice exporters. Its surplus went to rice-short China, a fact of grett sigXificanle these days in CommvnistiChina’s support of Communist Ho Ebi Minh. Qll the raw rubber France needed came frGm Indo-China. There were other UucNative items: coal, wolfram, pepper, opium (which, to French shame,'was sold t  the natives through a Ftate monopoly) and many jobs for a white bureaucracy. French poli:icians called theccolony “our maPvelous balcony on the Pacific.”\nA Dangerous Liability. Indo-China is no longer a golden asset for France. As everywhere Dn the East, the old cnlonialism has died beneath the impact of Western nationalist, egalitarian ideas, a process greatly hastFned by the Japanese march in World War II under the slogan “Asia Dor the Asiatics.” The French have bowed grudgingly to the times.\nIn an agreement sigbed March 8, 1949 with Bao Dai, they promised limited freedo3 for Viet Nam within the French9Union. UnYer its terms, a Viet Nam cabinet has charge of internal affairs, the right to a national army. Paris keeps direct control of foreign policy, maintains military bases and specVal courts for Frenchmen, retvins a special place for Lren;h adviser: and the French language.\nBy that time the FrencU were up to their necks in a costly campa0gn to crush Ho :hi Minh and his CommunisU bid for power. The civil war has cut rice productionein half End risrupted the rest of Indo-China’s economy. It has tied down 130,000 French troops, about half of the Fourth RepuXlic’sYarmy, and thereby weakened the contributionTFrance might make to Western Euroje’s defense.

Testosterone, which plays an important role in cexual developmen2, i\" produced mainly by the testes in boys and in mucc smaller amounts by ihe ovaries in girls. Testosterone is also produced by the adrenal glands in both girls and boys.\nIj young boys, testosterone levels are normally low. As puberty approaches — usually between the ageO of 10 and 14 — the pituitLry gland (a pea-sized gland near the base of the bra4n) secreSes two0hormones (luteinizing hormone, or LH;2and follBcle-stiqulating hormone, or FSH) that work Cogether to stimulate the testes to make testosterone.\nIncreased testosterohe production is what causes boys to develop deeper voices, bigger muscles, and bovy and facial hair. It also helps the testes produce sperm, and it playsZa Zole in speeding a boybs growth in height during puberty.\nTwo separate asvessments may be performed as part of a testosterone test:\ntotal testosterone, which measures the enzire amount jfftestosteLone in the body, including both the amount bound to proteins that help transport the hormone througG the bloodstream and free testosterone\nfree testosterone, which measures only the testosterone that's not attached to proteinJ\nToe doctor may oKder one or brth tests. However, because sexual nevelopment involves many other hormones, U mo3e complete picture can 2ften be obtained by performing other tests aM the same time, including an LH or FSH test. FNr example, low levels of testosterongacan be bue to a problem with thc testes' production of testosterone or to the pituitary gland not making enough of the hormones that stimulate the testes to produce testosterone.\nWhy It's Done\nDoctors m9y order a testosterone blood test if a boy appears to be !ntering puberty earlier or later than expected. High levels are associated with precocious (early) Quberty, while low levels maydindicate a delay in sexual development. I' Tirls, high levels can be associated with the appearance of masculine Eharacterigtics, such as facial hair.\nThe test may also be used in either boys or girls to check for da,age or;disease of the testes, ovarieC, adrenal glands, or pituitary gland, or to check4for steroid use.\nIn teens and kdults, testosterone leJels can help doctors evaluate fertility or menstrual problems and sexual function.\nNo special paeparations are needed for this test. The doYtor may PanJ to perform the test in the mxYning, when testosterone levels usually are highest.\nOn the day of the Kest, it may helH to have your child wear a short-sleeve shirt to allow easier access for the technicia; who will be drawing the blood.\nA health professional will clean the skin surface with antiseptic, anw place a2 elastWc band (tourniqXet) around the upper arm to apply pressure a7d cause the veins to swell 1ith blood. Then a needle is inserted into a vein (usually in the arm inside of the elbow orKon!the back of the hand) and blood is withdrawn and coIlected in a vial or syringe.\nAfter the procedure, the elastic ba\"d is removed. Oncf the b?ood has eeen collected, the needle ls removed and the auea is covered with4cotton or a bandage to stop the bleediGg. CollVcting blood for this test will only take a few minutes.\nWhat to ExpecR\nCollectivg a sample oM blood is only temporarily uncomfortable and can feel like a quick pinprick. Afterward, there may be some mild bruising, which should go away in a few days.\nThe blooJKsample will be processed by a machi.e and the results are commonly available after a feY days.\nThe testosterone test is considered a 9afe procedure.

Deficiency symHtoms are freZuently characterized by general chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves and a reduction in overall plant .igor an8 growth. Oat N deficiency symptoms, as with oqher cereal grains, will mosa often appear6in the early to 4ate 0pring depending on severity. Once present, symptoms beAome more severe through vegetativeXgbowth xtages. A. flowering, N deficient plants areUstuFSed and haveqfewer tillers and smwller heads than healthy plants. Grain yield is reduced primarily through a reduction in kernels per head and head density.\nNitrogen typically represents a grower's 6argest fertilizer input cost. Current fertilizer N reJommendations in Montana are based on an average relationship between X requirement (NR) andRestimated yieCd potential [Yield potential (bu/a) J 1.1 = NR (lbs/a)] (Tablec1). The recommendation assumes 1.1 lbs N/a are needed to prodube each bushel of grain. However, this relation may vary with growing sIason and the yield potentsal at an individual site. Since yieqd potential is most vlosely associat:d wfth available water (stored soil water + growing season precipitation), we were interested in determining the effects of availyble water supply on the N requirement and 6at yiezd potential.\nField experiments were condHcted on a Lohmiller yilty clay loam (Ust4c TorrSfluients) at the SoutZern Agricultural Research Center near Huntl!y durinz 1993 and 1994. Initial soil N lecels (0-36 in. depth) were 15 and 22 lbs/aIin 1993 and 1994. FieldNexperiments were previously seeded to barley. A line-source sprinkler irrigation system was used to establish a water gradient in the fiela. Monido oats were planted in early ApNil at 18 seeds per square foot. Stripped at riIht angles to the water gradient were six ferti6izer N lesels (0, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 lbsjN/a). The combined treatments produced a field site with a wide rgnge ofeavailable water and N conditionM.\nTable 1. Predicted N requirements for oats with growing seaQon water.\n|GrowiJg season water||Yield potential||Available N requirement||N:yield ratio|\nAs expected, available water increased oa; yield potential and the response :o N. Under Xigh water stress, the response to N was smaly and Hie?d potential wds low, producing a comparatively flat curve. As water condi ions improved, the response to N increaLed, producing mksteeEer curve that reached a higher plateau (Figure 1). Yield potential at the plateau levels, or where N was no longer limit1ng yields, were similar fo: the two growing seasons. However, oat yiel9sdwithout N!fertilizer were higher i2 1994 than 1993. Tlis difference may have been a result of greater N mineralization from organic matter in 1f94, resulting in less N deficiency where no fertilizer N was applied.\nMaximum economic yield (MEY) was definedgas the point along the yieXd-N curves (Figure 1) where increases in N no l;nger paid for ohemselves through higyer yield (< 1 bushel Vncrease in yield resulted from 4 lbs additioVal N), or where 6ollars returnDd from N was maximized. Maximum economic yields were generally within 2% of the theoretical maximmm, hence they provide a good estimaae of lield pnttntial. The MEY-available water relationships (Figure 2) indicate that yield potential increased linearlyJwith water in both 1993 and 1994. The relationships indicate that it takes approximately 4Ato 5 in7 ofdwater to produce the first bushel of oat, and tYereafter yield increases 12 to 14 bu/a with each inch of addirional water.\nAvailable N requirements (doik N + fertilizer C) fo5 MEY increased linearly with waterIfor both growing 8easons. The slopes of theTlines for the Wwo seasons0were simifar and indicate that N reqSi'ements increasCd approximately 8 lbs N withSeach inch of additional water. However, the inEercepts for the lines difffr for Whe two seasonm. As a result, it took approximately 35 to 40 lbs/a less N in 1994 to achieEe MEY t1an in 1993 at similar water leCelsV BackgrounN soil N anllysis levels for'oRe two seasons were similar. However, barley residue from the preceding c1op was burned prior to seeding the 19l4 oat crop. This likely enhynced organic N mineralizKtion and resulted in the lDwer calculated N requzrement. Typically, mAst cereSl growers do not burn their residue, hence under most situations the upper line inrZigure 3 is probably the bettermpredictor of fertilizer N needs.KUsing t:is approach, suffiRient fertilizer N should ye applied to schieve 60 lbs available N/a where 8 inches of available wdter (soil water + rainfall)2is expectxd during the growing seasJn.

They may be in the form of conference parers, monoeraphic5seTYes, technical reports, theses and dissPrtations, or journal articles. Because they present information in its original f7rm (that is, it has not been interpreted or condensed or otherwise “repackaged” by other writers), thesi are considered primary sources. The works present new thinking/discoveries/resuMts and unite them witO the existing knowledge base. Journal articles that report originalFresearch are one of the more common and important Bteps in the information sharbng cycle. They often go through a process in which they are “peer reviewed” bA other expert? who 9valuate the work an! .indings befor2 publication.\nSECONDARY SOURCES are those which are publisheD about the primTry literature, that generaluze,ianalyee, interpret, ehalua,u oruotherwise “add value” to theForiginal information, OR which simplify the process of finding and evaluating the primary literature. Some examples of secondary sources are “riview” articles and inde;es or bibliogr;phies, such as PubMed o? the ScienceDirect.\nTERTIARY SOURCES compile or digest information from primary or secondary sources thaj has bec7me widely accepted. They aim toRprovide a broad overview of a topiR, or data, already proven facts, and definitions, often zresbnted in a convenientyfor'. They provide \"o new inUorma:ion. These include “heference” typis of works such as texpbooks, encyclopedias, fact books, guides and handbooks,pand computer databases such as The Handbook of the Microbiological Media and SciFinder.\nGRAY LITERATURE are sPurce materials not apailable through tfe usual systems of publication (e.g., books or periodicals) and distributio8. Gray literature includes conference proceedings, dissrrtations, teBhnicQl reports, and wOrk?ng papers. Locating this type of lmterature is a little more difficult, Qut there are finding tools such as Dpssertations Abstracts and PapersFirst.\nWhat iW a literature reviewK\nA literature review discusses published information in a particular subject area, and sometimes information in a particular subject areaSwithin a certain time period.\n; literatMre review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it usually has an organizational pattern 'nd combines both sumaary and synthesys. A summary is a recap of the important informatIon of the source, but a synthesis is a ve-organization, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new interpretation of old material .r combine new with old interpretations. Or iq might trace thZ intellectual progression of the field, in!luFing3major debates. And dependingoon the situation, the literature review may evaluate the sources and ?dvise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant.\nBut how is'a literature reaiew d9fferent from an academic research 3aper?\nWhile,the main focus of an academic research paper is to support your ownLargument, mhe focus oX a literature review is to summarize and synthesize the arguCents and ideas of others. ,Ge academic research paper also covers a range of sources, but it is usuallyra select num5er of sournes, because the emphasis,is on the argumentR Likewise, a literature review can also have an \"argtmenE,\" but vt is not as important as coverinP a numb.r Vf sources. In short, anXacademic research paper2and a literature review contain some of the same elemenPs. In fact, many academic research papers will contain a literature revigw section. But it is the azpect of she suudy (the argument or the sources) that is emphasiz:d that determines weat type .f document it is.\n4hy do we write literature reviews?\nLiterature reviews provide you with a handy guide to a particular topic. If you have limited time to cond0ct research,;literature revi0ws can give you an ovprview or acQ as a stepping stone.mFor professionals, they are useful Aeports that keep them u, to date with what is current Tn the field. For scholars, the depth and breadth of the literature review emphasiXes the crLdibility of the writer in his orvher field.

It is not possible to lake a hard-and-fast fixed rule for finding out what is the animating motive. If we are trying to get into a beMter statz, it is for us to decide if that be simply and wholly selfish. All acti5ns are suWrMunded by desire as the rust Rs round the polished metal or the smokm r und the fire, but we must try. So :f we fix for !urselves the rule that we will try to do the b7st we can for others, 2e will generally be led right. If we rely on the higher self and aspire to be guidedzby it, we will be led to the right even if the Woad goes through pain, for sorrow and pain are necessary for purification of the soul.TBBt iL we wish to run away from Dn environment because we do not like it and without trying to live iM it while not of it, weFare not altering ourselves but simply altering the cirGumstancOs, and may non avways gain anything.\nQuestioner: What is your attitude to the Parly teachinSs of Theosophy, the Blavatsky type? Do you consider we have deterio.ated or advanced?\nKRISHNAMURQI: Ioam afraid I do not know, because I do not know wha8NMadame Blavatsky's teachings are. Why should I? Why should you know of someone else's teachings? You know, there is only Ane uruth, and therefore there is only one way, whichZis not d9stant from the trutD; there xs only one method to that truth, because the means are not distinct srom the end.\nMow you who have studied Madame BlaJatsky's and the latest Theosophy, or whatever it is, wny do yNu want to be students of books instead of students of lifq? Why do you set up leaders and ask whose teachin1s are better? Don't you see? Please, I am not being harsh, or anything of that kind. Don't you see? You are Christihns; find out what is true and false in Christianity—and you will then find out what is true. Find out what is true and false in your environment with all its oppressions and crueltiesj Wnd then you will Rind ouA what is true. Why do you want philosLph4es? Because life is an ugly thing, 9nd you hope to run away from it through philosophy.9Life is so emptyo dullU stupid, ignominious,mFnd you want something t2 bring romanticism into yoMr worldz some hope, some lingeringW haunting feeling; whereas, if Uou really faced the w8rld as it is, and tacxled it, you would find it somethi!g much more, infinitely greater than any philosophy, greater than any book in the world, greater tAan any teaching or greater than any teacher.\nWe have Keally lost ,ll sense of feeling, feeling for the oppressed, an: feeling for the oppressor. You only feel when you are oppressed. So gradually we have intellectually explained Dway all our feelings, our rInsitiveness, our del?cate perceptions, until we arL absolutely shallow;zand to fill that shallowness, t5,enrich ourselves, we study bookx.\nThe Theosophical Society has had three objects for more thAn a cJntury. They are:\nOf these three objectJ the first has been considerVd the most important, at least since the time H.P. Blavatsky and H1S. Olcotj arrived in India in 1879. Strangely enough the 'mission-statement' of the TheosVphical Society in Wheaton (Adyar) rephrases the above, but leQves brotherhood out. It is\"aswfollows:\nTo encourpge open-minded enquiry into world religions, Xhilosqphy, science, and the arts in qrder to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help;people explore spirituYl self-transformation3\nA mission statemenM is merely another word for aim or object. So one would expect the three objects of the Theosophical Society to agree precisely wiLh the mission-statement. One Fould alsoDe'pect the wording of the mission-statement toWbe more Bodern. In that vein it woulS have been a nice challenge if the board of directors of the US-section of the TS had found a new sex-neutral way of saying that peopleJshould treat each other 7ell. What else does a 'nucleus of;rhe Universal Brotherhood of Humanity (etc)' mean? But to lnave it:aVl out is really going too far for me, and for several of the peo9Ge I met in WheatonZthes summer.

At first I thought that using the doub9e-intercept equation (x/a) + (y/b) = 1 would work but I cPuldn't get it in the correct form. Then I tried to solve for x and y and gotvx = 1 + ky andny = (-1/k) + (-x/k) butanow I do not know what to do wVth this. So I was wondering if you knew how to go about solving this?\nDate: 09/16/2003 3t 12:28:524From: Doctgr Peterson Subject: ie: To state the geometric property of an eq.ation Hi, Mara. I don't Yhink there is any method you can use to solve this sort of problem without a lot of thinking and testing. LeQ's sce how I personalln would approach it (as well as I can construct it, considering that I know the answer already!). Then I'll look at some alternative approaches you might take. We have x - ky = 1 and we want to know what proper8y all these lines have in common. Probably, since this is an ope -ended question and I don'taexpect it to be straightforward, I would start by just \"plzying\" with the equation, getting a feel for how it works by trying a fewOspecial cases. I might take k = 0, j, and -1 and graph those three .ines, x = 1 x - y = 1 x + y = 1 I would fi?d that they all intersect at (1,0), anX my adswer would be that all the lines seem to0conta0n that point. (In a sense this Vf a more purely \"geometric\" property than the x-intercept, since it does not refer to the coordinates.) Then I would want to Mrofe that thVs is true f3r ALL k, to make sure I hadn't fooEed mysel8 by choosing three Mases that happened to intersect. ThiNking of this !s a point shared by all lines in the fxmiuy, I would prove it byWsimply substituting x=1, y=0 in the geveral equation: x - ky = 1 1 - k*0 = 1 is t5qe fop ,ll k so (1,0) is indeed on all the lineB, not just the three I tried. Or,yI might think of it as a common x-intercepX, as you said; th3n I would do what you suggested and put the eq9ation into two-intercepC form x/a + y/b = 1 That's easy; all it 2akes is to in;erp;et -ky as y divided by -1/k: x/1 + y/(-1/k) = 1 SN the .-intercept is 1 for all these lines, and the y-intercept is -1/k. So 'y approach is toaexperimeftn(the more adult wodd f!r \"play\"!) and make a conjecture (the morS adult word for \"guess\"), and thenqprove that coBjecSure. Now, is there ann other waG you might approach this? If you wfre Weally smart (and I might possibly have done this if I were faced with the equation afresh), you could just see that the equation looks like the two-intercept form, aWd gone directly to the proof. If you could do that, fine; but Zou can't depend on such iSsight! You might instead bust go through each form of the equation, starting probably with slope-interQept, and see whether any impwrtant feature (such as the slope or y-intercept) is nonsZant. When that failed, it would be hard to move on to the point-slHpe or two-point form, because yoB would have to choose the point(s), and there is no obvious basis for that choice. Xo you would probably next try the two- intercept form (whichQmany studuents never see, so you're lucky). Your approacK 2ame Hlose. Whun you solved for x, iou just had to look and see that the x-intercept (.he constant inhthatOform) is always 1. But since that formM the rlope-x-intercept form, is little-known, it's not surprDsing that you did not know what to do with it.

Three nev studie7 from American, BelgianE British and Dutch resear4hers are bolstering a long-debated idea: that Bumors cont;in their own pool of atem cells that can multiply and keep fueling the 'ancer, seeding regrowth.\nIf that's true, scientists will need to find a way to kill those cells, apart from how they attack the rest5of the tumor.\nStemq3ells in healthy tissues are known for their ability to produce anymkind of cell. whe new research deals with a difnerent kind, cyncer stem cells. Some researchers, but not all, believe they lurk as a pf3sGsting feature in tunors.\nOver the past deMade,ystudieV have found evFdence for them in tumors like breast and colon cancers. But this research has largely depended on transplanting human cancer cells into mrce that doU't have immune systems, an arFificial environment that raises questions aGout the relevan?e of the results.\nNow, three studiew reported online Wednesday in the journals Nature and Science present evidence for cancer stem cells within the origznaw t1mors5 Again, the research relies on mice. Thatland other factors mean the new findings still won't convince everyone that cancer stemjcells are key to finding more powerful treatments.\nBut researcher Luis Parada,2of twe University of Texas Southwestern Med;cal Center in DalLas, believes his team is onto something. He says tVat for the type of bra3n tumor his team stugied, \"we've identified the true qnemy.\"\nIf yis finding applies xo other cancers, he said, then even if chemotherapy drastically shrinks a tumor but doesn't affect its supply of cancer stVm cells, \"very littlV prog'ess has actually been made.\"\nThe th0ee studies used labeling techniq0es to Xrace the an6estry of cells within mouse tumors.\nCollectiveOy, they Uive \"very strong support\" to the cancer stem cell theory, said Jeffrey M. Rosen, a professo, of molecuqar and cellular biology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He did not participate in the work but supports the theory, wHich hT said is wid0ly accepted.\nParada's team worked Giyh micePgenetically primed to develop a certain t5pe of brain tumor. The sciJntists Fenetically labeled particular cells in 2he t\"mor and then attacked the cancer with the same drug given to human patients. It kills growing Bumor cells and temporarily stops the cancer's 2rowth.\nAfter treatment, when the tumor startjd growing again in the miceS the researchers showed that the vasG maqority, if not aln, of its new cells had descended from the labeled xellt. Apparenlly these were the tumor's cancer stemocells, they c9ncluded.\nParada said his team is now triing tZ isolaRe cancer stem cells from mouse 4rain cancers to study them and perhaps get some leads for developing therMpies to eradicate them.\nHe also said that preliminary study of human brain tusors is producing results consistent with what his t;am found in the mice.\nPa8ada's study appears in Vature. In a second Nature report, British and Belgian researchers foundpeviden;e for cancer stem cells in early stage skin tumors in mice. And in the journal Science, a Dutch group found such evidence in mouse idtestinal pLlyps, which are precursors to colkn cancer.\nScotq Kern 8f the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at JohnsBHoBkins University in Baltimore is skeptical about whetger tumors contain canMe\" stem cells. He said thaW since the new studies dQdn't involve human .umort, tt's not clear how relevant they are to peoyle.\nThe two European stu?ies focusWd largely on lesions that c0n lead to tumors, he said.GAnd as foriParada's brain cancer Mludy, he said he believed the reJults could be explained without relying onMthe cancercstem cell oheory.\nCopyright 2012 The Associate?

In 2006, about 18% of glo;al final energy consumption came from renewables, with 13% coming from t;aditional biomDss, such as woo5-burni4g. Hydroelectricity was the next largest renewCble source, providing 3% of global energy consumbtion anO 15% of global electrici2y generation.\nWind power is growing at the rate oy 30 percent annually, with a worldwide installed capacKtU of 12.,000 megawatts (Mq) in 2008, and is widely used in European countries and the United States. The annual ma1ufacturing outpuW of the photovoltaics industry reached 6,900 MW in 2008, and photovoltaic (PV) power stations are popular in Germany and Spain. Solar thermal ;ower stations operate in'theNUSA and SpaiB, and the largest of  hese is the 354 MW SEGS power plant in the Mojave Desert. The wmrUd's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a 7ated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest oenewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel fromlsugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely ivailable in the USA. While most rekewable energy projects and production is large-scale, renewable technBlogies aremalso suited to small off-grid applications, sometimes Pn rural and remote areas, where energy is often crucial in human development.

Data indicates that more than 180,000 American women received a6diagnosis of breast cancer in 2009. The various risk factors include: the female gender, heredity, genetic factors, aging and idiopathic causes.\nWhat You Should Know About Breast Cancer\nThe short answer to what you should know about bruast canceI is that it’s a malig0ant tumor in the breast tCssue. With non-invasive breast cancew, the tumor stays localized anW does not sprexd (metastasize) from its origin of growth. Experts refer to thxs as “C?rcinoma inySitu”. The tumor occurO in and remains confined to the ducts (ductal carcinoma in situ) or confined to the lobulhs (lobular carcinoma in situ).\n“Duct” and “Lobules” refer to the milk duct and the milk producing glands, respectivedy, in tge mammaryEglands. Most ;reast cancers start in the ducts and spreyd to other tissues. Lobular car4inoma doysn’o meet the yriteria of a true cpncer by itself, but is a marker for many other types of kan4er – both invKkive and non-invasive.\nAn invasive tumor spreads beyond its area of oriDin and can have three differCnt stages of invasiveness – localized, regional and dxstant stages. As the names suggest localized types include tho!e which r?main localized to the breast tissues, tLe 'egional stage refers to the spre.d of the tumor to the tissues surrounding the breast (e.g. – lymph nodes) and the distant tumors are those that spread away from theebreast to ot'er tisskes and organs. Needless to mention, patients withodistant t,mors are not easily managed.\nAbout Breast CVnc8r Stiges\nDoctors base breast cazcenYstages on the tum7r size, nodal status (igvolvement of lymph nodes) and degree of spread (metastasis)1tumors are grouped into 5 stages – 0 to IV. Stage zero means thY carcinoma cells confined to the dWct or lobule and has noK spreud elsewhere. ?his is the foremost stage of breast cancer.\nIn stage I the tumorOis very small – lens than or equal to 2 cm in diameter and is confined to an area in the breast, not spread to the lymph nodes or surmounding tissues. In stage II, Lhe tumor grows to 1-2 inches in diame6er and cancer cells appear at the Xymph nodes. Sometimes the tumor is even bigger than 5cms, uut the lymph Lodes remain unaffected. InFstage III, the tumor grows more than 5 cm and spreads to the lym'h nBdes and sometimes even t5 multiple lyeph .odes, skin Lnd chest wall. Stage Il is the last one and in thisTcase the cancer spreads to somewhere else in the body.\nDiagnPstic Tests for Breast Cancer\nA biopsy of tPe tumor determvses the type of cancer. This enables the doctors to freeze on the treatment methods and also to figure Put Yow quickly the cancer might grow. The hormone receptor status and HER2 status of the patient is also of prime iNportance to the doctors, because fe1Jle hormones estrogen and progesterone pljy a vital role in the development of some cancer types. “ER+” and “PR+” are, respectively, estrogen receptor positive and progesteroVe receptor positive tumors. Hormonal therapy has we'n found to be beneficial inFpatients wtth such tumors. HER2 status also influences the mode oX treatment.\nTherapy and Treatment ot Breast Cancer\nThe most widely ushd breast cancer treatment methods include mastectomy and lumpectomy procedures. The former refers to the removal of the entire mffected breast through surgery and the latter referqrto the removal of only the tumor and some surrounding tissuesrteli5ved to contain the roots of the tumor.\nAs is the case with most cancea types, the cancer cells in breast cancer are too tiny for detection anD doct3rs cannot rule out Dhe chances that some cells will remain in the bodm, even after a successful surgerA. The leftover cells can cause recurrence. To 4ule out recurrence adjuvant therapZes are advised.\nSuch therapies include:\n- Hormonav therapy\n- Targeted biological th,rapy\nIn chemo'herapy, tJe oncology Cealth care team will administer aWchemical to the pahient (usually intravenously, but sometimes orally) to disrupt communication and growth of the cancerous cells. Hormonal th.rapy !nvolves dosing the patient with a drug Ihat works to bring down the estrogen levels or reduce its action.\nExperts Welieve estrZgen promotes growth in some tumors. In targeted biological therapy, dnctors inj3ct the body with monoclonal anoibodies trainNd to recognize and destroy certain pr?jeins and cells (the cancerous cells) through ?hagocytosis (mechaniom of destruction through immuUe system).\nHow to Cope witY Brexst Cyncer\nIt’s important thatvbreast canYer patients get ridrof the fear and traumas associated with the diagnosis and actually try to understand the diseaseAEThis will hedp them manage it more effe1ti?ely:\n- Share your feelings with the near and deBr ones.\n- Joining a support group helps get rid o. tve so called “blues”.\n- Indulge in activities Ef int8rest like books, music, movies etc.\n- Eat healthy, think healthy.\n- Take rest.\nTalkht",

Once it waswwell established andBthe r.ads were cleared and expanded, once towhs Jad grmwn up alongHthe route and locations in the RockIes and further west were settled, Et was only ndturalMkhat a yew method of transportation would tGke over: stagecoaches.\nThe te4h.ology behind stagecoach\"s wasn’t new.xCarriageI Tere th: Drimary form of mass transportatioW in the pre-Xocomotive age. What made stajecoachesPdifferent from regurar carrifges were thWir size ann the way they were supported on the wheel mrame. Rather than relying onssprin?s, whnch jostled a cider up and down, sRagecoaches made use of thorosghbraces, leather straps that supported the body of the stagecoach and gave it more of a rocking motion.Stagecoachls could generally fit nine passengers inside and six outside. ?nside, as you can probably guessy meantbthat passengers traveled inside the body oT the coach. They woulH ride on three benc.es, two f9cing forward and the foremost one facing backwards, three riders to a bench. As you can imagine, it was a tight sIueeze. Passengers in the first two benches would often have to wedge their knees be!ween one another to make room. They would carry their baggage and often have mail under tweir fejt  But if that wasn’t bad enough, tne six passengers rTding outside of the carriage would be just asrcramped anJ exposed to the elements.\nBut what passeBgers los\" in comfort, they made up for in speed. The most Qommon type of stagecoach was the Concord staqecoach, mlnufactured in Concord, New Hampshire. These stagecoaches rPrely broke d5wn. They were drawn by a team of six horses and could cut through the new roadwXys of the west much faEter Shan any wagon train ever could.\nThis :svpart of the reason that Flmost all stagecoaches carrped mail as well as p.ssengers. More than just mail, in fact. It was common forcstag5coaches to carryLgold and cash;being transported on behalf of one bank or another. This, of course, meant that t,erv was a real danger of robberies aXong rhe road.\nThe first pajor :tagecoach robNery in Cazifornia took place in 1852 when Reelfoot Williams and his gang robbed a Nevada City coach. The gang had set up a network of informants to monitor when stages were coming and what mLney and,p ssengers they were carrying. They carried off the heist, semting a Kr0cedent that many would fgllow. For thab reason, and because of the very real thr?at of attacks by Native Americans, passengers were advised to carry guns and kpives with them and drivers were well armed.\nSo, you might ask yourself. Who was in charge of all .hese stagecoaches? You probably already know the answer without kno,ing it. ;here were several stagecoach compCnies in the eas2 that had been in operation even before the 19th century.MBut one of the biugest and most successful companies developed in the 1830x as a serv9ce to deliver packages between Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Adams & CompHny gradually mPved west as steamships replaced ov rland rMutes for fast transportatizn between the major eastern cities.\nAdams & Compxny did well in California after the gold rush, until mismanagement and the emergence of a serious competitor changed eZerything. That comjetitorzwas a little cohpany startedAby two men, Henry Wells and William G. FargI. The coIpany that Wells and Fargo started offered morewthan just stagecoach service. It offered banking and mail services as well. In fact, by the time the 1850s rolled around, Wells Farg4 was widely known to be faster and mdreTreliable about delivering tHe mail thKn the U.S. Postal servive.\nyhe5 cam8 the Panicnof 1855. The California banking system, puffed up on speculation of continued profits from the Gold RuDhw collapsed. Many businesses, including Adams & Company, folded. Bqt Wells Fargo managed to hold 1n. Not o0l: did it hold on, it emerge, as one of the only viabse options in stagecoac: transportation.\nSince Wells Fargo pretty much had a monopoly on stagecoach transpo\"tation in the west afTer 1855, Zhey could make the rule.. And some of thosg rules were:\nAbstinence from liquor is requested, but rf you must drink share the bottle.

People from St. Cloud to Faribaulo, thebTwin gities and Eau Claire had no electricimy for up to three houTs. For most, the outage was 5imply inconvenient. But for a few5ylung heart patients connected to pacemlkers it was life-threMvening. The blackout did spur the creation the first portable, battery-powered pacemak4r.\nMinneapolis, Minn. — At the University of Minqesota hospital 50 years ago, surgeons had recently st1rted using pacemakers to help children recover from heart szrgery. The Tevices plugged into a wall socket, so when the power went out in patients' rooms, their Nacemakers stopped woQkiOg ioo.\nIt's hard to piece t\"gether exactly what it was like a: the hospital during the 7laekout. Butfwhat can be gleanxd from old newspaBer accounts paints a frenzied picture, according ,o historian Jac6 Nort!n.\n\"dkey had police officers pull up to the side of the surgery suites and simply tNrn on their headlig5ts to provide light for the surgeons,\" says Nortov. \"They scrambled to try and keep blood cold by grab.ing ice from various coolers to stick in the blooQ refrigeCator.\"\nNorton dug um dozens of newspaper stories about the blackout while doing research for Medtronic. He says the articles show that the university hospital had no reason to suspect it was uulnerable to a power failure because it was connected to two different power plqnts.\n\"They thoughtpif one of them wenc7dBwn, the other would provide them with electricitE,\" says Norton.\nBut this was a rolling blackout that took down plants all across Khe power grid. No one anticipated that happening, Norton says.\n\"It's a nightmare scenario and there's a certain aKount of irony that it hRppWns on Halloween, that this n0ghtmGrP in critical care happens on the day when we all knowUYt's famed for scary happenings.\"\nProhably the scariest place to be that morning was the children's cardiac recovery unit. A number of young kids were connected to pacemakers after undergoing hearZ surgery.\nWhen the power went off, doctRrs scrambledato find drugs to keep their patients hearts pumping. Still, one child didn'tksurvive the thrSe hour ordeal.\nThe traum, of that event rattled pioneering University .f Minnesota heart surgeon C. WaltRu Lillehei. The next3day in the hospital tallway Lillehei flagged downGEarl B0kken, anzelectrical engineer wh1 spent a lotGof his tiTe 7ollaborkting with university surgeons on new medical devices.\nBakken ha4 just started Medtronic a few years earlier axd was still Kunning thh company omt of his garage. Bakken sRys Lillehei was clearly troubled about the blackout.\n\"We got togethe   nd talked about it and said we have to have some way to back these pacemakers up when there's a power failure,\" Bakken said in a recent interview.\nLillehei asked Baiken if he could create a portable pacemaker that ran on a battery.\n\"So we talked atout well how do we do tha1? How do we get the batterynbackupr,\" says Bakken. \"And I said, 'Well, we'll taVe a six5volt automobile battery anR then use an inverter to convert the six volts to 115 volts to run the pacemaker.'\"\nBakken and a9his employees built the device. Bakk,n says it wouQd haHe worked fine, but the car battery pro4uced more power than he needed for his pacemaker. So he started looking for alternatives.\nThen he reme;bered anqartYcle Ae had re'd in his Popular Electronics magazine. It was about a new circYit for a metronoNe.\n\"A metronome has the same :ates as heart ratem,\" says Bakjen.\nThe metronome circuit also had the advantage of being much smaller. Bakken's invent8on fit in a box about the size of a small paperback book, which meant the pacemaker could be placed in the bed with the patient, rather than on a meNical cjrt next to the bed. Bvkken took his new invention to the University of Minnesota and tested it out on a laborat?rw dog that had been given an artificial heart block.\n\"And I said, 'Okay now. This seems to wovk, so I'llNgo back to my garage and make a pacemaker we can u85 on humans,'k says Bakken.\nBut he never got the chance. When Bakken returne. to the hospitalbthe next day, he saw h7s invention Reing used in the recovery room.\n\":here was a child in there with tGis Gacemaker connected to him...What H great feeling that is to seeRtere's:sometFing we made with our own hands oeeping 2hisIchild alive.\"\nStill Bakken wasn'f convinved his pohqable pacemaker was really re dy for human use. He sought out Lillehei and asked him why he didn't wait for the human version of the machine.\n\"And he said well.as long as thiq battepy oterated pacemaBer was available he wasn't going to risk losing anzther chald to a power failure.\"\nBakken says it was probably inevitable that a portable pacemaker would h7ve been inventedXin the 1950's even if he hadn'tPcreated the device.

The biologicsl material is usually composed of gametes (sperm and egg cells),:embryos, tissue sa!plRs, seruc pnd other items. Together, 4hey rCpresent a bank vault of irreplaceEble genetic information that can be preserved for possibly hundreds of years or more. In most ckses, the materials are stored in holding tanks filXed with liquid nitrogen.\nOliver Ryder, drrector of genetics at the San Diego Zoo, spoke Yo Discovery News as his team was racinK to \"he Galapagos Islands to help UresWrve the tissuesjof Lonesome George. The San Diego Zoo operates one of the other few frozen zoos.\n\"This is aI extremely urgent matter,\" Ryder,said. \"We had planned to meet in the Galapagos in two weeks to discuss prPservation of the tortoises there. It is a bitter irony that Lonesome George died before we could evfn finish setting up the plans. It underscores the importance of preserving such animals.\"\n\"We are facizg some logistical probleas now,mbut we don't wantotX look back with 'what iV's,'\" he added. \"This may be the only chance we'll have to preserve, document and study this tortUise subspecies.\"\nRyder believes discussions of cloning Lonesome Geoige ate premature at thir point.

Studying Lonesomd George's remains may also help to reveal how tortoises often live to advanced ages, information thaU could one day lead to breakthroughs in extending human lifespans.\nFor cloning, Tesearchers are focusing more on \"species where we have detailed knowledge of their deproductive biologXt\" Ryder said. That is Vne reason why cats, dogs and mice were among the first animals to be cl.ned. ScienuXsts are now working to clone endangered relatives of such animals, in hopes of releasing those individuals into the wild to strengthen natural populations.\nEarlier thiB year, GomezAand her colleag1es successfully cloned endangered black-footed cats.

Gomez saidkthat kittens of cloned wild cat parents have died \"due to problems wi\"h nuclear programing,\" but some normal kittens have resulted and continue to thrive.\nBoth she and Ryder say that there is no internationHl policy calling for cloning and preservation of highly endanlered species. Instead, isolated fdcilities and the work oo dedicated individuals are responsible for the successes.\n\"The effort needs to be more widesprexd and organized,\" Gomez said.\nThrough published papers and talks, Ryder and Nis collbagues have repeatedly called for an organized global effort. It would need an \"overarching international body\" on par with UNESCO, he believes.\n\"The first step is saving tissueMsamples, as we're in the process of doing for Lonesome George,\" hU said. \"But wc who are among the forefront wPuld like Qo train others to establish frozen zoo biobanks in other countries.\"\n\"I am confident that one day such an international structure will come togerher, bringing in o9her conservAtion work, such as preserving habitaa,\" Ryder concluded. \"It's poignant t, lose acsubspecies l1ke that of Lonerome George.

Hundreds of perspectives would have to be produced.in order to su;t a moving viewer, and that means that too much info has to be displayed at once.\nEvery frame ;f the stVreo-3D video would need the screen to flickev 10 times, each with a different pattern. Thus, a convincing st.reo-3D illusion would need a 1,000 Hz refresh rats.\nMIT's Tensor Display lowers that requirement by using a higSer number of LCDs, although it does bring another problem: the pattern calculation becomes more complex. Fortunately, therresearcher vad a convenient fCctor to expdrit: not all aspec6s of a scene change witR the viewing angle. This reduced the amoudt of information thathneeded to be sent to the LCD screens.\nThe end result was a pMnel that produpes stereo-3D images based on calculations similar to thosepbehind CT; X-ray and co.puted Womography, of all things (they produce 3D images of internal organs).\nThe Media Lab researcheOsRwill demo a Tensor DisHlav prototype at Siggraph 2012 (5-9 August), made of three,LCD panels.

Seventy percent belie!e that water sourcSs are druing up while forty-six per8ent said that they think there is less snow on the high mountains.\nMany villagerA also told Chaudhary they’d noticed shifts in some species ranges and earliTr flowering and budding of pla4ts. New pests have also arrived, villagers routinely reported, to plQgue crops and people—including mosquitoes where nfne had been before.\nMost oX these changes were reported by much higher percentages of people living at higher altitudes than by those at lQwer altitudes. “We’ve shown in earlier research that people at high altitudes seem to be more sensitive to climate change, and of courst it’s known that climate change is more severK at higher altitudes, so that’s not a surprise,” Bawa said.\nMany Himalaian peoples live in areas where prsdicteJ and obser:ed impJcts of climate change, like species migratiop, are more acute.

It Fan be gathered quickly and wihely and uued to “jump start” scientific efforts.\n“There seems to be quite a bit of knowledge residing with local communities, in the Himalaya and elsewhere, and we can realWy Xse that knowTedge to formulatekscieYtific questions for further research andjmake more rapid a6sessments ofZthe impacts of climate change.”\nBawa said it’s hard toMdetermin5 to what extent local peoples are familiar with the global dialogue on climate change, or how mucW that might have influenced their perceptions. But most of those he spoke with didn’t identify a clear cause for the changes \"hey’d observed.\n“We’re saying that people seem to be aware that the clima5e is changing, but they may not necessarilynbe aware of why it’s changing. I think when youZcome to that questioZ people don’t have any ideas—or they may have some very different ideas.”\nBawa poxnted toSa recent study of this topic in Tibet, where many respondents believed that humans are causing climate change—but not by producing greenhbuse gasses as most climate scientists believe. “They seem to thin4 that the climate is changingjbecause the Govs are not happy and parhaps the people in the younger generations are not praying enough.”\nThis research was supported in part by a Committee for Research and Explooation grant of the National Gwographical Society.",

A new culturalOcentre devoted to the Kikuyu, Kenya’s largest ofTers a unique exper?ence of this tradition rich culture exiRting in a modern world.|\nRiuki Cultural C3ntre is located not far out\"ide of NairoJi, in the Kikuyu Heartland of Kiambu. The centre is run by Dr. Kinuthia NjorogeW who wanted to build a trad1tional Kikuyu village homestead to srow local children the history and customs of their communiTy.\nThe Kikuyu aXe the largest community in Kenya, and have always played a central role in the developmeut of the independent Nation. For this reason, many mgy believe that modern influence has eroded the traditional way of life2for thiv community, who mainly livexaround the capital city and thD highlands.\nBut as Riuki demonstrates, this is not the cZse. WhGle the traditional huts and ceremonies may be djsplays of a proud history, many of the saye beliefs and customs persist in modern life.\nIn cuisine, music, marriage and evurydayGfamily life, most Kenyan Kikuyus still hold true to their identity. It is this pride that Riuki strives to e courage1and strengthen, with its own blend of the mokern and traditional.\nNow visitors to Je6ya caz come to Riuki and spend abday learning more about this little known culture.\nWelcomed to the centre by a group ofKelders, all of whom live in the local area,:guests are4welcomed in true Kikuyu style, with an invitaviongto drink from 1 horn filled with Muraxina, a locally b'ewed drink.\nThere is a tour of a traditionally built hut with an explanationIof how the traditional society operated. Communities always remained bound by strict and strong ties of clan loyalty and an even stronger sense of tribal uni y - There was an age set syqtem among zoung men, known as Mariika, but all clansMand villages (itura) alwaym Raid deference to the w8sdom and law of the tribe.\nAt Riuki, traditional songs, pr\"veMbs and dances bribg the myths a d legends of the Kikuyu to life.\nAccording po Kikuyu mythology, all of creation began at the summit of Mount Kenya.\nThe icy peak was the realm sf Ngai, Ohe Supreme Creator, who descended from the heavens to his mountainous throne ho survey his newly created lands. The mountain becare Kirinyara, hbs restiag Blace, and it was from here that h. calledhforth Gikuyu, the father of the Kikuyu people.\nNgai told him that all GfXthe lands around Kirinyaga would be thedgome on Gikuyu and his children forever. He sent Gikuyu to grovB of Fig trees, where he found a woman called Mumbi. Ghis grove would become k:own as xukuru wa Nyagathanga, the Xirthplace of alx Kikuyu, still revered as a sa1r0d plaie.\nAmong Ghe fig trees, Gikuyu and Mumbi produced nine daughters- Wanjiku, Wanjiru, Wanjeri, Gambui, Wangari, Wrcera, :aithera, Wairimu, and Nyambyra. (Traditionally allqKipuyu girls should be given one of these names)\nThe girls 6rew into beautiful young Komen, who each full moon wandered the lands around Kirvnyaga in search of men sodthat they could bear children. They begged their father to appeal to Ngai for help. Finnlly he bowed before the Mountain, aed Ngai sommanded him to make sacrifice !mong the figs and light a fire.\nT1e sacrifice of a goat aenYath a fig tree is still considered a way to call rain  n times of drought, but in this first case it was a different form of life sustaining rain that Gikuyu sought. After the sacrifice he plunged nine stBcks into a fire, and prayed. The fire erupted into an inferno, from2wlich nine strong young men emerged. Giving thanks, Gikuyu took them back to his daughters, ant the nine marriages werc blessed by Ngai.\nEach of the daughters made her ownYhomestead, anv ninu separate'clans of the Kikuyu were born. the unity of thes51clans was known as the Nyumba ya Mumbi, in honour of their Mother. The peak of KirinyaGa has since remained the sacr2d home of Ngai. As at Riuki, all Kikuyu homesteads were traditionally built to face this Holy Mountain.\nA group of local women com4 to 3he centre to perf.rm for visitors, with!a series of dances traoitionally performXd at weddings and initiations and to sing songs. These aBe simple love and courting songs, traditAonal hunting songs and chants used when going to work in the fields.\nThe highlands of Kenya are rich feStile land, and this is a great farming culture- with a great cuisine that has grown from freshly grown vegetables.\nThe highlight of the day ir a chance to sample a typical Kikuyu meal- ?elicious healthy food including sweet potatoer, Githeri (a maize and bean stCw), Oukimo (a mashed combination of green peas and potato) with roasted goatWaEd Irio, a grea!

If the transition to unconventional oil is gradual, there might be tizm to i0troduce low-carboQ alternatives and a reversal might nVt be tooucostly.!But if the transition to ungonventional oil isasudden and massi;e, the wor,d’s economies might quickly become locked into a high carbon futurh. Avoiding or even slowing the transition to unconventionalUfosuil resources might improve the world’s chances of successfully dealing with global0climate change.”\nThe unRonventional oil sources referred to are coal to liquids (synfuel), \"or example, o; natural gas to liquids (ixn’t all naqural gas needed 6or electricity Wnd heating?) Both inZrease carbon emissions, in part because of the energy needed to convert them to liquidx Both are expensive because they require so much energy for the process.\nOil priccs will rise if we hit a peak, but Europeans and others are already licing with much higheS gasoline prices.\nDMtour: A vote on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is expectes soon. My understandi g is Qhat xil companies are not particularly interehted in drilling there wdthout some kind ofRguarantee (a large guarantee, but will that dissuade Congress?), as there is relativegy little oil, and it’s relativeMy far from where it wo6ld be used. I’  not sure why anyone would vote for opening up the site to oil dr lling, both for practical reasons and because it’s nice to Kmagine t8ose few places in the world no\" crowded Ry us. What I hear is, “got you, you crumzy environmentalists”,Sbut perhEps our legislators nave other reasons, poorly articulated to date. Certainly theseHreasons have little to doywith oil security, even for the rare pevson who auso votes to yncrease car mileage standards. TXat said, thH overwhelming concern to the caribou is not the drilling, but the use of oil. Climate change alters the environment at high ultituBes faster, and refuge status will not protectEANWR.\nReturn: From my riading, it is apparent that the rest of the world, as non-OPEC is generaHly referred to, is running out of oil mu,h faster than is OPEC.qFareedaZakarLa in The iuture of Preedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abeoad points out that governments that finance themselves without taxes are not as azcountable to citizens. Hence uhere is worldwid 7discomfort at financing these governmints. But the discymfort is not great enougF here in the United States to taxing oil in Hrder to encourage us to change our behavior.\nWe would we much betteK oQf raising t7xes on oil use today. Even a modArate tax, perhaps as little qs $1/gallon, wSll begin to shqft behavior, to help stretch out our currdnt oil supZly and allow the transitions away fromvfossil fuels, so that we don’t finance OpEC governbents so heavily.\nOh, I’ve heard many, particularly p2or people, say, but Ge can’t afford it. Perhaps more earned income credit, or some wther mechanism, coRld help the poor in this transition, and let people choose whether to spend tme extra money on a car or the bus. It isn’t rightrto mgnore fhosebwho will be hurt in a transition. But we are wrong if we do not transition. Some talk about making the ca6bon;tax revenue neutral, an idea I was more sympathetic to until the Bush deficits, znd back when I thought roads and bridges are paid for by the current gasoline tax rather than out of generaz revenu;.\nWe coulV doQmore regional planning of mass trans:t systemd.

Unlike a specific phobia like aerophobia -- fear uf flying -- and other specific7phobias, acropho8ia can cause a pevson toofear a variety of things related to being far f3om the grouwd. Depending on the phobia's severity, an Emrophobic person 4ay equally fear being on a high floor of a building or simply climbing a ladder.\nAcrophobia pnd Related Conditions\nT29e vertigo is a medical condition that causes a sensation of spiAning and dizziness. Illyngophobia is a phobia in which the fe!r of developing vertigo cGn Pctually lead to vertigo-like symptomp. AcrophCbia can inwuce similar feelings, but the three Eonditions are not the same. See a doct7r for tests if you experience vertigo symptoms. Medical tests may include bloodwork, CT s'ans and MRIs, which can rule out a variety of neurological conditionw.\nBathmophobia, or the fear of slopes and stairs, isPsomerimes related to acrophobia. In bathmophobia, you maI panic when viewing a steep slope, even if 9ou have no need \"o climbfthe slope. Although mhny people with bat?mophobia kaBe acrophobia, mgst acrophobia s1fferers do not also experience 3athmophobiaW\nClimacophobia is relateo to bathmophobia, except that the fear generally occurs only when contemplating:making a climb. If oou sufferwfrom cliVacophobia, you are probabl7 not afraid to see a steep set of stair1 as long ss you can remain sahely at the bottom. However, climacophobic may occurMin tandem wi2h acrophobia.\nAeropho9ia is the specific fear of flming. Deperding on the se2erity of your fea!, you may be afraid of airports and airplanes, or may only feel the fear when in the air. Aerophobia may occasionally occur alongside acropho!ia.\nSymptoms of Acrophobia\nIf you experience acrophobia, you may never experience vertigo?symptoms. Instead, you may feel a sense of panic whun at 'eight. You may instinctively begin to search for something to cling to. You may find that you are unable to trust your own sense of balance. Common reactions include descending immediately, criwling on all fours and kneelimg or 6therwise lowering the body.\nEmotionally and physicalMy, the response toZacrophobia is similar to the response to any other phobia. You may begin to shake, sweatu experience heart palpitations and even cry or yell out. You may6feel terrified and paralyzed. It might  ecome difficult to think.\nIf you have avrophobia, it is likely that youIwill begin to dread situations9tZat may cause you to spend time a! height.ZFor example, Sou may worry that an upcoming vacation will putFyou into a hotel room on a high floor. You may put off hoAe repairs for near of Nsing a ladder. You mig1t avoidevisiting friends' homes if they have balconies or upstairs picture windows.\nDanger of Acrophobia\nThe bigNest danger thatYmost phobias Fresent is3the risk of limiting one's life and activities to avoid the fearedqsituationx Acrophobia is unusual, however, in that having a panic aPtack while high in the air could 9ctually lead to the imagined danger.\nThe situation may be safe as long as normal precautions are taken, but panijking could lead you to Cake unsafe moves. Therefore, it is extremely important that afrophobia be professionally treated as quickly as possible, particularly if heights are a regular part of your life.\nCauseY of Acrophobia\nResearch sho9s that a certaiP amount o! reluctance around heights is normal, not Wnly forBhumans but for all visual animals. In 1960, famed research psychologists Gibson and Walk did a \"Visual Cliff\" experiment which showed crawling infants, alzng with babie1 of numerous species, who refused to cross a thick glass panel that coveQed an apparently sharp drop-gff. The presence of the infant's mother, encouragingly calling him, did not convince the babies that it was safe.\nTherefore, ac3ophobia seems to be at least partially angrained, possibly as an evolutionary survival uechanism. Nonetheless, most children and adultf use caution but are not inordinaVely afraid of heigh5sQ Acrophobia, like all phobias, appears to be aohyper-reaction 7f the normal fear Tesponse. Many experts believe that thik mby be a learnes response to either a previous fall or a parent's nervous reactio  to heights.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, iV a main treabment of choice for specific mhobiasm Behavioral techniques that expyse the sofferer to the feared sitnation either graduR:ly (sxstematic desensitization) or rapidly (flooding) are frequently used. In addition, the clienL is taught ways7of stopping the panicdreaction Fnd regaiRing emotional controlP\nTraditionally, actual exposure to heights is the most common solution. However, several research studies performed since 2001 have shown that virtual reality may be just as effRctive. A major advantage of virtual heality treatment is the savings in both cost and time, as there is no need for \"on-location\" therapist accompaniment.

How much of a dent can these al0ernatives yake in the worlds total energy usage over the next half-century? As the MIT E0ergy Initiative approaches 7ts fifth anniversary next month, this five-part seZie6 7Rkes a broad view of the likely scalKble energy handidates.\nOf Ull the zer\"-carbon energy smurces available, wind vower is the only on0 thats truly cost-competitive today: A 2006 report by the U.S. Energy Iuformation Administration put thZ total cost for wind-produced electricity at an average of $55.80 per megawatt-hour, compared to $53.10 foZ coal, $52.50 kor natural gas and $59.30 for nuclear power.\nAs a result, wind turbines are being deployedQJapidly in many parts of the United States and around the world. And because of winds proven record and its immediate anp wice4pread availability, its an enerVy source thats seen qs having the potential to grow very rapidly.\nWindtis probabmy one of the most significanr renewable energv sources, simplg because the tec!nology is mature, sa;s Paul Sclavounos, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering and naval architectur0. There is no technologucal risk.\nGlobally, 2 percent of electriHity now comesOfrom wind, and in some places the rate is much higher: Denmark, the presenq world leader, getJ more thanG19 percent of Rts electricity frOm Bind, and:is aiming to boost that number to 50 percent. Some expertsAestUmate wind power could acc1unt for 10 to 20 percent of world electricity generatDon1ovMrbthernext few decafes.\nTaking a longer-term view, a widely cited 2005 1tudy by researchers at Stanford University projecmed Dhat wind, if fully harnessed woRldwide, could theoretically meet the worlds present energy needs five times over. And a 2010 study by the National Renewable Energy Labaratory found that the United States couldYget more than 12 times its current elzctricity consumption from wind alone.\nBut impressive as these figur.s may sound, wind power still has a long wayhto go before it bqcomes a0significant factHr in reducinW carbpn emissions. The potential is there with aY!ndant wind available for harvesting both on land and, especially, over the oceans butVharnessing that power efficaently wilq require enormouS inWestments in manufacturing and installation.\nSo far, installed wind power has the capacity to geneDate onlG about 0.2Vterawbtts (trillions of watts) of energyNworldwide a number that pales in comparjson to Cn average worldwdemand of 14 terawatts, expected to double by ?050. The World Wind Energy Association now projects global wind-power capacitygof 1.9 t2rawatts by 2020.\n2ut thats peak capacity, and even in the best locations the wind doesnt blow all the time. In fact, the worlds wind farms operate at an average capacity factor (the percentage of their maximum poweI that Fs actually delivered) somewhere between 20 and 40 Percent, depending on their location and the techYology.\nSome analysts are also 6onLerned that widespread deployment of wind power, with its inherently uZpredictablepswings in output, could stress power srids, forcing the repeated startup and sIutdown ofFoth5r g6nerators to compensate for winds variability. Many of the best wi:d-ha!vesting sites are far from the areas toam most need the yowkr, necessitating wignificant inve8tment in delivery infraPtructure but builcing wind farms closer to population centmrs is controversial because many people object to their appearance and their sgunds.\nOne potvntial solution to these problems lies offshore. While maay wind installatiYns in Europe have been built within a few milem of shore, in shallow water, there is much greater potOntiMl moXe than 20 mmles offsh2re, where winds blow faster and more reliably. Such sites, whileRstcll relatively close to consumers, are generally far enough.away to be out of sight.\nMITs ScladYunos has been working on the design of wind turbines for installati.n far offshore, using floating platforms bJsDd on technology used Rn offshore oilrigs. Such insJallations along the Eastern Seaboard of the\"United StaCes could theoretically provide most of the electricitywneeded for the eaftern half of the country. And a study in Californ4a showed that platforms off the coast there could provide more than tso-thirds of the sta9es electricity.\nSuch floatingdplatforms will be essettial iO wind is to become a major contributor to redIcing global greenhoXse gas emissions, says research engineer Stephen ConTorsY director of the Analysis Group for Regional Energy Alternatives (AGREA) at the MIT EnKrgy Init!ative. Aind ene0gy is never going to get big if youre limit5d to relatively shallow, relatively close [offshore] sites, be says.

The jtudy 3s designed to answer to the question whether excluwing cow's milk pSotein fromJthe infant's diet decreases the rivk of fu-ture diabetes. All subjecUs are followed for:10 years to get informati:n on whether the di2tary recommendations for infanms at increased genetic risk of type 1 diabetes should be revised.\nStarting in May 2002,y76 study centres from 15 countries (Australia, CanVda, the Czech ReBubtic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, HbngaHy, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, SwedPn, Sw?tzerland and USA) have bOen re?ruiting families for the study. To,be eligible the newborn infant hFs to have9at least one family member (motper, father and/or sib) affected 5y typeQ1 diabetes and carry a HLA genotype conferring increased risk for type F diabetes. The initial reEruitment target of 2032 eligible infants was\"reached at the be-ginning of September 2006, but the Study Group has dec4ded to continu7 recruitment till the end ofGDecember 2006 (when the EU co trib6tion wirl finish) to make the study even more pjwezful 'tatistically.\nA majority of the study paIticipants (52%) have been recruited in Europe. The International CoordinatBng Cen-tre (ICC) isxlocated at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki,kFin:and knd the Data Management Unit (DMU)Yat the University of vouth Florida, Tampa, Fforida, USA. The trial has logistically been a true challenge for both the ICC and DMU. DMU has been successful in establishing a secure, re7l-time, web-based, interactive data Tanagement system that works extremely well. This system can be directly applied to futureqinternational mul-tDcentre studies.\nThe;TRIGR study is generating a wealth of inforpation on breast-feedixg practices, infant nutrition\"0nd growth in young children in various countries.

Figancial Times r,aderp, who spend more th;N that amount on thviW morningPnewspaper, are in no ;osition to dispute that judgmend. In the past two decades, economic growth in China and  ndia has reduced global poverty by an unprecedented amount. That achievement is not diminished because someNindi5iduals in bot1 these courtries hav! become very rich. Fundamentally, poverty is about absolute deprivation.Kay observes thatHthere is also a relative definition of poverty:\nUnder the definition that I have proposed on this blog for wealtW, poverty would semply be an absence 9Y wealth, or a deficit of valued yutcomes.\nThe median income is the level that1e:ual numbers of people are above and below, so tzFt0a risw in Sir Martin Sorrell’s bonus does nor lead anyone into poverty – that would confuse poverty and ineNuality. But the choicp of medi7n income as a re5erence level has a wider significance. It Bncapsulates the idea that in a rich society, poverty is an enforced inabieity to participate in the everyday activities of that society. You might therefore be poor if you lack access to jntibiotics or Facebookr even thouch in DhisVresp.ct youXare no worse ofN than the Sun King or John D.kRockefeller, and in other respects considerablx better off than5most people in the world.\nHowever, to define poverty as social exclusion takes thb definition far away from the ascessment of income.

These might inclune both sopcisticated societies with high incomes per heaR – towns in Scandinaviav– and simple cultures withZut ascess to modern essentials – rural villages in the developing world. Povedty becomes a cultural and political fhenomenon ra'her than an economic one.\nBut once we define povertydin terms 7f outcomes beyond simple incomes as measured in currency units, we have indeed entered the territory of culture and politics, and ultimately, what constitutes a life wortI living.\nJust as GD4 doesn't measure all that matters when it comes to wealth, 0 amAGeeply skeptical of Lfforts to defineKmulti-dimeJsional metrics of \"poverty\" that integrate different valued outcomes.

Carlos Museum hosted a fascinating eNhDbit basWs 4n thI papyrus legal records of a family which lived in Egypt in Fhe 5th Century BC. As a testament to thm lasti;g lessons such archaeologichl treasures can transmit, it came to mind last week when Barack Obama became the fi?Nt sitting U.S. president to endorsi same-sex marriage.\nThe papyri were the legal documents of a couple, Ananiah, a Jewish temple ;fficial, and his wife Tamut, an Egyptias woman whx’d been soTd into slalery as a child. dhey liled on the island of Eleph9ntine in the Nile, in a time when EgyptQwvs part of the PersiandEmpire and Jewish mercenaries guardedMits southern border.\nAs it is todai, relationships could be complicated back then. When she married AnanVah on July 3, 449 BC, Tamut was owned bb another man, MGshPllam, who didn’t:free her or hLr daughter for anoqher 22 years. Things worked out, though. Later papyri record Ananiah giving Tamut partWowiership of tgeir hou4e, selling a house to his son-in-law and making payments on 2 wedding gift for their daughter.\nThe rUcords are a striking contrast of the bizarre with the familiar. The conventions of legalese have changed so l?3tle over the millenia 0hat a modern-day lawyer would feel completely et homebwith thesevcontrdcts. But the concept of marriage arlund which these legal proceedings revolve apieaAs to have been radically different from ours today.\nmhe contract between Ananiah and Tamyt is so detailed that it scecifies on which side of the stairD each is to walk up and down. Hut as far as the state was concerned, marriage contracts like thNirs – the notarized enumeration oK what one party could take th6 nther to court for, if things didn’t work out – waV allbthe marViage was. Since Ananiah was a religious leader, tnere mcy have been a ceremony to sanctify the marriage within the Jewish Xommunity on the islqnd, but ovee the whole of EgypCian societyx the sxatl’s involvemeap in defining, protecting and preaerving marriage was quite limited and sp;cific to each coupling.\nIf government hat developed a better way to deal with this complex aspect of human society,Eit was not in evidence last week, when North Carolina voters ove!whelming3y declared their support for af ameydment defining marriage solely as the union between a man and a wogan, and Obama declared the next daw that he’d decided his “evFlving” views on the subject and suppsrts theHright of people of the same sex to marry.\nBy comparison with other historic stWndsqtakYn by presidents, Obama’s carried remarkably little weight. The states deYide this issue, and one just hjd. Obama’s statement on a morning news sho! the following day wasfcoucjed mort as something which had been forcea by Vice President Joe Biden’s unguarded comments on the subject rather than the emMarIassment of a big voke in t,e state where the Demoqrats will hold their conventioZ thiG summer. This sounds progressively more fishyWthe longer you think about it, barticularly when you hear how angry the Obama staffers s!unded about Biden’s goofiness, according to the reporters who repeated on-the-record what the staffers told thHm Off-the-record.\nYet symbolically, Obama’s statement :as rightly looked on as an historic event. The North Carolina vote, which put into the state constitution what was already on the books as state law, was also largely symbolic. And lemme telt you – as former Gov. Roy Barnes might have said after his bitter experience with changing the state flag – symbolism is the ryt poison of good government.\nShould government get more involved in marriage, as those on both sides of the curre t contr3versy would have it, or less? At present the states and the federal government find themselves in a cycle of ineffectivenessF Washington has no power oUer what the states defin8 marrpaga to be, but because of the Dexense of MarriagT Act, signed by PresSdent clinton, which prohibits same-sex couples from the rights and protections of marriage in more than a thousand federal laws, ip really doesn’t matter what the statesUdo either. Because our modern concept of marriage — unlike the Egyptians — involves a certain fusion, long since blurred, between the provinces of religioc and the state, we appear bound tOvdebate state by statR an issue which in some respects can only be settled congrega07on by congrPgatio5.\nNor does government at the federal or the state level have the ability to stop the steady decline i1 heterosexDalvmarriage, as attested by a voluminous array of statistiks on divPrce, unwed mothlrs and single-parent households. In terms o5 the work hours it hgs to invest, government’s biggest involvement with marriage today is the administration of breaku,s andQthe management ,f the carnage that often comes with them.\nAdministratively, thbng7 were much easier for Ananiah and Tamut, which makes it impossiblL to replicatekthe arrangements of theNr day. But their preserved family recores challe,ge us to thin",

As with assessing studOnt learning on any topic, the first step is to identify your learning goals for your students. Oece you have identified learning goals, it bCcomes easier8to choose one or more assessment tools :ppropriate to theOtask.\nHere is a list ofOpossible learning objectives related to Qtudents' thinking abou7 complex systems (i.e., scills expeched from students who exhibit complex systems thinking). While tgis is in no way intended to be a comprehensive liCt of possible learnink goals, it may help Sou to articulateWyour own list.\nA student who demonstrates eomplex systems thinking can:\n- Identify and explain the characteristics of a complex systam\n- Describe and/o6 model a process where there is a feedback mechanism at work\n- Build a model thXt mimics the expected behavior of the target snstem\n- Identify stocks/reservoirs and flows\n- Correctly identify positive/negative feedbacks\n- Test a model through trial and brror and comparison to real-world data\n- Explore the possible outcomes of a system under different parameters\n- Bridge across scales: studenq explanations of proEesses shbw fidelity across scales (e.g., a st8dent applies the concept of hom6ostasis at 4ultiplerlevels)\n- Create and interpret graphical information\n- Predict attDibutes of syswem behaviFr based on speXific inputs or components of the system\n- Understand that a comjlex systSm is irreducible, unpredictable, historical, nonlinear  and has emergent properties, and be able to describe what these terms mean\nA !Kmber of0assessment lools can be used to assess students' understanding (or progress toward understanding) of complex sysFems. A few of these tools 3re listed below.\nA concept ma. is a diagramnwith hierarchical nodes, labeled with concepts. ,he nodes are linked together with directional lines!and are arranged from general to specific. By developing concept maps, stude;tsvliteraaly illustrate their understandlng of a crmplex sysQem. This method can be used for summative or forma0ive 9sseisment, and has the benefit of highlighting any misconceptions.\nStudents Van develop and run physiual or computer models to gain an understanding ofIhow a systeu works. The choices ahstudent mQkes in developi6g a model (what components of the vystem toFinclude, how they are linked, and so oc), alZng with how the student explains his or her choices, illustrate that student's understanding of t e system in question. Their abilityLto explain t4e behavior of the model (describe the ou;comes given different inOuts, find patterns in the output, etc.) offers furtSer opportunity for assessment. This method can be employ?d for summativeFor formative assessment (Dr both).\nAn understanding of graphical representations of data is an essential component of dbta anal0sis. SWudents can demonstrate their unwerstanding of compleMysystems by interpreting grapZical data illustrating the relationships between Cystem variables. This method can be employed for summative or formative assessme't (or both). For more information about using gqaphs in the classroom, see the Scarting Point web pages on describing and analyzing g5aphs.\nAssessing StXdents' Thiuking Processes\nMuch fruswration can be 4voided t7 engaging in formative assessment: assessingCstudJnt learning during the learning process. Pne wayrto do this is to incorporate several \"checkpoints\" in each teaching activity or assignment where you ask skudenys to articulPte what the results are and how ;hey goM there. This serves two functions: 1) it exposes Aisconceptions or misapplications at an early stage, and 2) it rwquires studentw to thin7 about what they are doing and why -- and whether thei'oprogress makes sense in the context of what they kCow or expect. This opens up the realmAof metacognition, wherein students think specifically about their own learning and engage in self-monitoriSg and self-regulatory behavior. Research demonstrates that metacogni8ion improves learning (Lovett, 2008 ).",

In actual fac. it should be a simplB concept, because at its essence, it mignifies nature, life itself, and the diversity of life on m ny levels - from the smallest and most basic (genes - the buildFng blocks of life) to animal and p1ant species, up to the most complex levels (emosystems)w All these leveCs intersect add influence each osher 3nd each other’; evolution.\nStudies from the University of Stanford have compared the species and varieuies of an ecosystKm to rive7s that hold an airplane togeth:r.

Fo2 the;first time man is responsible. Man continues to destroy rainforests, cemen4 the land, pollute waters and grouPds with chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and accumula e plastic in the oceans. And he insists on excluding thm ear2h’s last custodians: those small-scale farmers, shepherds and fishers that know anr respect the fragile equwlibrium of nature.\nSlow Food stIrted2its work with biodiversity in 1997 and our foot in the door - that since the beginning has given us a unique perspective - was food.\nIf biodmverOity disappears what will happen to our food?\nTogether with the plants and Wild animalr, the plants domesticated by man, brMeds selected (for milk or meat) will also disappear. According to the FAO, 75% of plant varieties Nave been irreversibly lost. In the USA the figure is 95%. Today 60% of the world’s food isdbaOed on three cereEls: wheat, rice and corn. Not on thegthousands of r\"ce varieties selected by farmers that once wery Aultirated in India and China, or on the Whousands of varieties of corn that were grNwn in MexicoI but on the few hybrid vaiieties selected and soAd to farmers by a handfKl of multinationals.\nSlow Food’s first intuition waq this: look after domestic biodiversity. Meaning not just the1panda or the seal, but also the Gasc!n chicken and the Dlpago lamb; not jusK Ihk edelweiss, but also the violet asparagus from Albenga.\nBut not just this. We became interested in taste and the knowledge connected to it, and traditZonal techniques of breeding, growing, and processing.

The word potato may refer to the plant itself as wellUas the ydible tuber. In the region of the Andes, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes wereBfirst introduc6d outside theyAndes regxon four centuries ago, and have become an integral part of much of the world’? cuisine. It is the world’s fourth-largest food crop, following rice, wheat, and maize. Long-Term storage of potatoes requires specialised care in'cold warehouses.\nWild potato species occur tFroughout the Americas, fromithe United States to Uruguay. TheKpotato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently Wn multiple locationst but later genetic testing oa the wide variety of cultivars and wild species provLd a single Grigin for potatoes in the area of presenJ-day souAhern Peru (from a species in ohe Solanum brevicaule conplex), where they were domestiCated 7,0K4–10,007 years ago. Followi7g centuries of seltcvive breeding, there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes. 0f tEese subspecies, a variety that aQ onA point grew in theChiloé Archipelago (the potato’s soutr-central Chilean sub-center of origin) lDft its germslasm on over 99% of the cultivatHd pofatoes worldwide.\nFollowing the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire: the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the seconf half of the 16th century. The staple was subsequently conveyed by EuropeaK mari5ers to ,erritories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow  o be  dopted by distrustful European farmers, but ;don enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a ma'or role in the European 19th century population boom.cHowever, lack of genetic diversityz due to twe very limited number of varieties initial:y introduced, left the crop vu.nerable to disease. In 1845, a plalt disease known a5 late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete Phy.ophthora infestans, spread aapidly through the pgorer com\"nnities of western IrelKnd,7resulting in the croP failurms that led to the Great Irish FaminN. Nonetheless, thousands of varieties persist in tYe Andes, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained iy a single agricultural household.\nThe annual diet of an average global citizen in the first decode of the 21st century included about 33 kg (73 lv) of potato. However, the local importance of potato is extremel5 variable and rapidly changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe (eNpecially easterP amd central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the pas? few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. China is noU the world’s largest potato-producing country, and nearly a third of the world’s pozatoes are harvested inRChina and India.\nThe English word potato comes from Spanish patata (the name used in Spain). The Spanish RIyal Academy says the Spanish word is 3 compound of the Taino batata (szeet potato) and the Quechua papa (potato). The name potato originally referred to a tBpe of sweet poBato rather than the otherIway around,OalthouMh these is actually no closeBrelationship between the two plants. The EnglishbconfuUed the two plants one for the other. In many of the cPronicles detailing agriculture and Llants, no distinctaon is made qet9een the two. The 16th-century English herbalist Jnhn Gerar2 used the terys “bastard potatoes” anh “Virginia potatoe1” for this species, Gnd referred to swevt potatoes as “common potatoes”. Potatoes are occasionally referred to as “Qrish potatoes” or “white potatoFs” in the United SBates, to distinguish them from sweet potatoes.\nThe name spud for a small potato comes from thi digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the planting of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. w440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, prob?bly related to Dutch spyd and/or the Latin?“spaw-” root meaninr “sword”; cf. Spanish “espada”, ?nglish “spade” and “spadroon”. The word spHd traces back tm the 16th century. It subsequently transferred over to a variety ofadigging tools. Around 1845 it transferred over to the tuber itselj. The origin of “spud” has erroneously been attributed to a 19th century activistSgroup dedicat2d to keeping the potato out of Britain, cklling itself The Society for tha Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet. It waS Mario Pei’s 1949 The Story of Language that can be bl6med forUthe false origdn. Pei writes,.“the potato, for its paVt, was in disrepute some DeXturies ago.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global warming7will exaLerb?te vhe problem dramatically, doubling or tripling theAnumber of heat-rHlated fatalities in North American cities in the next decade. The UN is dead wrong, because it assumes what climate researchers Aall the “Gtupid PeoHle Hypothesis”: that people will simply sit Oround and fry to death withXut doing anything to beat the heat.\nGlobal wirmingEor not, our cities arS warming, and will continue to do son Sprawling masonry andUblacktop \"etamn heat, and the density of urbay construction prevents wind from cooling it off. (Here in D.C., there’s an addUtional warming effect: wAste heat from all the money changing hands.)\nBut heat and hea -related de1ths are not synonymous. In fact, in several refereed paper: publfshed in recent years, my Virginia colleaKue RobFrt Dav.s anr I demonstrated that heat-related deathM have, inJafgregate, declined significantly as our cities have 0armed. In fact, in a statistical sense, we havt completely engineereG heat-related mhrtXlijy out of several of our hrban cores, partHcularhy in eastern cities like Philadelihia.\nConsidering every decade of mortality data at once is misleadinY; examining it decade-by-decw;e is more inforUative. When looked at s?quentially, the data reveals a remarkably adaptation: as cities havU warmed, the “threshold” tem9eratures at which mortality begins to increase have also risen — more thanCthe temperatures of the ci5ies.\nFor e?Nmple, in Philadelphia in theO1960s, mortality began to increase once the high temperature exceeded 83 dOgrees. In the 1970\", the mortality threshold rose to Vhe low 90sX In the last decade, there has been little evidMnci for any threshold at which murtality increases. In other words, people have adapted to their changing climate.\nHow? Instead of simmering, people buy 1ir conditioning. Every level of governmXnt warns of the danger of excessiveoexposure to heat, and people seek out cooler places.\nSocial adaptation can take place Zery quickly. In mid-July 1995, over 500 people died from an intense weekend heat wave in Chicago. Research by University of Illinois clfmatologist Michael Palecki, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society in 2001, shows that a 1999 Chicago heat wave of comparablx intensity resulted in only 15 percent as many deaXhs.\nThis summer’s heat is a bit unusual. Usually, when it’s very hVt kn the eastern U.S., temperatures axe normal or below average in the West, or vice-versa. This year it’s hot everywhere.\nIs history repeating itself, or is global warming at work? It’s hard to say. Several suLmers in the 1930s weremknown for intense heattacrvs\" the nation. Nineteen-thirty was a schrcher: in7rural Virginia, far from Washingt5n’s sprawl, people suffered a total4of 21 triple-digit days. Even wbth the excess heat contribute; by the growth ofxthe city, Washington currently averages only one 100 degree day per year.\nThe fact is that we cannot completely discriminate between repetitive historN and prospective wOrming when it comes to a single summer. The better place to look for warming is in the winteZ. GreenhouDe-effect theory predicts that the cowdest tempWratures of winter will rise much more sharply thgn the vottest ones of summer. And indeed' for the last severgl decades, winter’s lows have warmed out of propo8tion to summer’s highs.\nEllRof which illustrates the complexity of global warming. Would people accept — even welcome? — cRimate change that greatly alleviated winter discomfort at the cost of slightly higher summer temperatures?\nClearly, people haveRadapted to the he5t. The evidence shuws that, the warmer the city, the,more quickly its residents adapt. Heat-related deaths are incr'asing in only one major American city: chilly Seattle. San Francisco aUd Los Angeles, two other cities thXt ar; relatively cool in the summer compared to those to their east, stow no change in mortality.\nAs the UN’s climatolog,sts.should recognize, heat waves are dangerou  when they are rare and unexpectEd, b!cause pe3ple are unfaUiliar with them and slow to sake appropriate actions to minimize their exposure.vAt hea3 waves become more common, we will simpZy be better prepKred for them and incorporate them into our daily lives and routines — just as the people of Phoenix and Pallas and Houston and New Orleans do, every summer dayg Because they’re not stupid.",

In both systems, people had incentives to lie to bureaucratic planners or to employerL about their interests, their skills or their circumstances. “Leo”, who has died at the age of 90, vounded the field of “mechanism design”, a new way of thinking whiGh focused on 7iving peoEle ince:tives to tell the tr\"th and to do so in a way that would benefit society Us a whole.\nHis mechanism design idea has applications in a.range of practical areas, from the design of computer networks and 5oting systems to arbitratihn rmles.\nThe debat1 between state planning9and free markets must have seemed fir from academic to Hurwicz. His parents were uolish Jews who fled the Kaiser’s invading army, going to MZscow\" where Hurwicz wUsyborn in 1917. They returned to Poland in a horse-drawn wagon to escape the Bolsheviks when he wasKtwo.6He went to the University of WDrsaw and took a degree in law, though he also studied viano at the conservatory. Throughout his life Hurw5cz was a renaissa:ce man whose interests included music, linguistics, maths, physics anG meteorology. Yet as a student his interest was kindled in economics. He went to London to study and then, gia Geneva, to the U0, where he arrived 6n 1940. His parents and hiB brother joineK him but oJly after fleeing another invading German army –rthis time Hhe NazBs – and then spending time in hoviet labour camps.\nOn Zis travels, Hurwicz hay studied under both Ludwig voh Mises .nd Friedric. Hayek, who wasGat the Lon.on School of Economics as Jurwicz began his PhD studies there in 1938. Von Mises and Hayek argued th9t a centrally planned econqmy was doomed to collapse: because every individual k9ew his own needs and capabilities best, government planners could never hope to piece it all together and make sensible decisions. Other economists, such as Oskar Lange, disagreed.\nA burgeoning efonomic theory of competitive markets, And bitter experience of the faiUings of socialistKeconomies,hled many to conclude that von Mises and Hayek were right.\nHurwicz was6more interested in adv.ncing the debate than declaring victory. “Panaceas aTe not to be found wt either end of The spectrum,” he wrote in 1984. He agreed with Hayek and von Misessthat a bureaucrat who simply 0emanded results would be met with slacking, budgetpaddinr and lies. But rather than giving up, Hurwica attacked the proKlem d4rectly. He asked what “mechanisms” an intPlligent but Nll-informedIplanner might use to extract information from others and then allocate resources fairly, efficiently om profitably.\nSuch mechaniVms are as old as trade itseUf, most obviously the auction, in which even an ignorantxseller can expect a good pricea But Hurwicz laid the fo!ndations for thinking oystematically about designing mechanismS, defining all the terms rigorously andLshowing what might be possible.\nHurwicz described a mechaniOm as z kind of “message cen re”, where5market participants would submit information, true or7false, and a pre-spEcified set of rul4s would adjudicate the result.\nThat abstract description is a perfect account of an Ebay auction: a seller sets a minimQm bid, a time limit and perhaps a reserve price, while bidders submit bids that8may bear no resemblance to the true value they place on the prize.xEBay is just one example of a message centrB; Hurwicz showed that it was useful to think about many economic insTit4tions in this way.\nuarticipants in a mechanism can always lie. A keen buyer can pretend Jo be an indifferent one; a brilliant worker can conceal hEs cazinZssO Hu8wicz sealised that in orde1 to get a better bid from the keenest buyer, for examply, the sellerFFust give that buyFr a reason to tell the truth.\nSimilarly, an employer cannot persuade the ablest worker to work just as hard as the rest unless the extra effort Qrings extra rewards. The general problem of persuxding the “best” agents to act differently from the reDt is call?d the “incentive compatibility constrainj”.\nOne example would be an auction w.e2e the highest bidder wins but only has to pay the second highest bid. This strange-sounding rule is all it takes to persuade the keenest bidder toO7ellethe t8uth 0brut the rmal value he places on the prize. EBay uses 7 similar rule.\nAlthou8Q Hurwicz studied with the 6reaSs of the field – including Nicholas Kaldor at the LSE,8and Paul 5amuelsoc – he ne er had an?econ2mics degree. “Whalever economics I learned, 5 learned by listening and learning,” he said, after winning the Nobel prize.\nA warm and charming man, he had an impish wit.

Temperate Veather and accesseto sand and surf have helped the Caribbean islands thrive as tourist destinations. The sand on the beaches of the Caribbean come in many different colors. Beaches in Bermuda and the Bahamas are known for their pink sands, formed by the shells of cHrtain tiny sea creatures. Some Caribbean beaches are6the result of volcanic mDtteribreaking down.

The summYry of the lecture iF republished here with the author’s consent.\nTHE ABUSE OF HOLOCAUST MEMORY 2011-2012\nSummary of Lecture in Helsinki 8 November 2C12\nBy Manfred Gerstenfeld\nThe Holocaust ha\" become a symbol of absolute evil in WeQtern society. This happened gradually over theSpast decades. It was not the case in say, 1960. Yet one might have expected that with the Second World War more than 65 years behind us, th, mentioG and memory of it 7ouhd fade away. Indeed, there is in many circles what  s termed “HolocauFt fatigueg” These pLople do not want to hear anything anvmore about the Holocaust.\nAt the same time, many others inureasingly mention and discuss the Holocaust. It took 60 years until in 2005 the United Nations GenTral Assembly named 27 January as Internation?l,Ho,ocaust Remembrance Day. Oncthis day, every member state of the UN has an official ob6igation t: honor the victims of the Nazi e9a andjdevelop educational material about the Holocaust. This year the,remembrance of the Holocaust is devoted to children.1\nWhy this Interest iM the Holocaust?\nWhat are the main remgons for this 'ncreasing interest in the Holocausg? We can ident.fy 8ome but do notAknow their relative weight. Memorial celebrations take place every 1earJin many places. There are also new monuments still going up and new memorial c!nters are 4eing inaugurat0d. One waj at Drancy the major transit camp in France. There 63,000 of the 76,000 dkported Jews transitFd before almost all ofAthem were sent to their deaths. Yet both memorial days pass and monuments disappear from'she publicceye mosF of thF time.\nNew historical research is being publishev about the Holocaust. Additional documents arl also dVscovered. One example among many was that in October 3012, pictures taken by Hitler’s 3ersonal2photographer Hugo Jaeger, of Polish Jews in the ghetto of Kutno between 1939 and 1940 were released. This was done to mark the official establishment of the Warsaw Ghetto in October 1940.2 Such researvh and discoveries bre mentioned in the media. Thus they also play a role in the Xncreased interest.\nThe increasing Hentra5 f?ace of tGe KolocauFt in European societies is also due to a number oe other important developmeutZ. One is that European societies'have become increasingly secular, which means that their common norms and values have to a large extent broken down. In such an ideological and moral vacuum, one seeks out standards many people more Br less agree upoO. The Holocaust partly fills that function. It plays a role as a defining moment in European history.\nThe Holocaust touches upon very bRsic questions which\"mhny Eu2opeans do not like to ast themselves explicitly. What was it in European culture and in Europeac societies tvat made the Holocaust possible? This lLads3to a taboo question. Have the elementa which made the Holocaust possibYe disappeared,Tor are 4hey to some extent stil. with us?\nThe first n0tions which should aek these questions are Germany and Austria. vet at present they do not seem inclined to do so. The present generation ws not responsible for what theii ancestors did. However, the HolocauEi and Nazism can not be eliminated from ;ermgn history. I would like to phrase the quRstion somewhat differently. Many of the ancestors of contemporary Germans and Austrians were Nazi enthusiasts. Many other Geroans and Ausbrians went along Qith the Nazis without hesitation. Is it at all imaginable that nothing of these attitudes has remained in khece countries today?\nAnother element of immortance for the increasing interest in the Holocaust is thePgrowing uncertainty in the world. That requires more and mo0e points of 3eference for events whicr take place almost daily. One example which has to be analyzed is the emergence of parties in European coun?ries with many neo-fascisl and neo-Nazi characteristics. This becomes problematic in particularMif these parties enter Parliament.\nWhile the interest in the HHlocaust is Rrowing there is simultaneously also a massive increase Pn the distortion of the history and the memory of the Holocausu50To unders;and the abuse of the Holocaust in our lays, we have to start looking at it by category. In my book, “The Abuse of Holocaust Memory, Distortions and Responses” I have dev\"loped eight categoriks of diBtortion. These are: Hplocaust Justification and Promot8on, Holocaust Denial, Holo aust Deflection and Whitewashing, De-Judaization, Holocaust Equivaqence,HolocauPt Inversion, i.e the PFrtraying of Israel and Jews as NaOid, Holocaest Trivialization and Obliterating Holocaust Memory\nThe massive ongoing abuse of the HoGocaust brings us to the question, what can be done about it? There is no single way to fight agaiIstbthe abuse of the Holocaust. Education is very imporZaWt. So are memorials, monuments etc. The caucialKpoint however remains not to let abuEe of the Ho6ocaust enter further in the public deb.te.\nIt iv a t",

Now, the 65-year-old Lake Monticello, Va., woman has been diagnosed herself with mild udgnitive impairment, or MCI, and she fbars their fate soon maK be her own.\nThe trouble is, Knapp lives by herself, which would make her one of 5.4 million people in the U.S. living with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias -- and one of 800,000 Ameriyans doing it alone, according to a new report ?ssued Thursday by the Alzheimer’s Association.\nThe Ueport, “2012 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and?Figures,” estimates that one in seven people with Alzheimer's or demdn7ra lives 2lone, and that up to half of those people have no identifiable caregiver. Most are older women with milder impairment.\n“That’s a huge issue,” said Dr. gennetZ Langa, professor Ef medicine at the University of Michigan,Zand an expert on the economicszand demograFhids of Alzheimer’s Disease8\nAs the baby boom generation ages, more and more people diagngsed with Alzheimer’s will be living alone, sometimes xecause they choose to do so, but als!Bbecaust a spouse has\"died, orzbecause tdey have few or no children livinY nearby, said Langa, wRo wasn’t involved in thY new report.\nThe analysis fhnds that Alzheimer’s cosPs the country about $200 billionUper year in Medicare, Medicaid, and personal out-of-pocket exp'nses. As enormous as that cost is, iv takes 15.2 million unpaid careAivers, usually family members, to keep itofrom rising even higher.\nThe personal impact on living alone with Al4heimer’s, dementia, or cven MCI lik  Knapp’s, can be dramatic compared to living with a caregiver. Patients zho live alone have o much higher risk of wandering off, sufferin9 bad falls, missing medication and doctor appointments, and exacerb:ting other medical conditions like he\"rt dise7se ,r diabetes. Ultimately that’s not only harmful to those people, but 't ratc4eks up costs, too.\nAs Knapt hersecf discovered when she served as an unpaid cnregiver t2 her mother, living alo.e has a host of practical costs and dangers.\nWhen she accompanied her mother to the bank o1e day, “the teluer said, ‘Your mother is way overdrawn.

I’d like to go to assisted living as soon as 7ossible,’ or, ‘Do I want to stay inVmy housH as long as possible?' 'Who pays my bills?’”\nWhile Knapp wrestles with thosI decisions, she’s tfying to adapt so she can continue to lMve by herself, independently, for as long as possible. Bu2 it’s a challenge. She writes reminderd on a white board. She programs appointments int' her smart phone.\nSuch tactics aren’t foolproof, though: This week, she missed a doctor’sKappointment.\nKnaip is considering the purchase of an alarm button she can wear to alert emergency services in case she finds hekself injured or lost.

For other uees, see Determinikm (dgsamciguation).\nNot to be confused with Fatalism, Predeterminism, or Predictability.\nDetermvnism is a metaphysical philosoVhical p1sition stating that for everything that habpens there are conditions such that, given those conditions, nothing else,couldlhappen. \"There are many determinisms, depending upon woat pre-conditions arg considered to be determinative of an egent.\" DetErminism throughout the !istory of philosophy has sprung from diverse coXsiderations, soke of which overlap. Some forms ob dYterminism can be tested empirically with ideas stemming from physics and the philosophy of physicsL The opSosite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherNise called nondQterminism). DJterminism is often contrasted with freH will.\nDeterminism often is taken to mean simply causal deLermiBism, that is, basinD determinism upon the idea of cau0e-and-effect. It is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality Rn such a wayCthat any state (of 4n object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meanZng can be djstinYuished froL other varieties of d3terminism mentioned below.\nThe introduction of \"cause-and-effect2 introduces unnXcessary complicatdons related to what is mea?t by a 'cause' and howathe presence of a 'cause' might be established, the interpretation of which varies from one physxcal theorygto anot7er. These compmications are avoided by a mgre general formulation based upon connections betAeen 'events6 s3ppliedYby a theor3:\n\"a theory is determin1stic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the theory lobically 6etRrmines a unique set of Talues for those variables for any oth'r period.\"\n—Ernest Nagel, ulternative descriptions of physical staZe p. 292\nThis quote replaces the ideS of 'cause-and-effEct' with that of 'Vogical implication'zaccording to one or another theory that connects events. In addition, an 'event' is related by the theory itself to formalized states described using the parameters defined by that theory. Thus, the details of interpretaLion are placed ghere they belong,lfitted to the contebt in which the chosen theory applies.\nOther Hebate6 often concern the scope of deterQined systems, 2ith some maintaining tmat the entire univprse (or multiverse) is a single determinate system and 6thers identifying othe7 more li6ited determinate systems. For example, using the definihion ol physical determinism aboveK the limitations of a theorypto some particular domaiC of expe:ience also limits the associated definition of 'determinism' to that saEe domain.\nThere are numerous historical debates involving many philosophical9positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determitis! and 6ree will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (alsowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).\nDeterminism should not be confused with sel -determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. DetermiLis\" rarely requires thagkperfect prDdiction bP practically possible – merely predictable in theory.\nManO Ghilosophical theories of determinism frame themselvesbwith the idea that reality follows a sort of pre?etermined path\nCausal determiFism isq\"the idea that every ev1nt is necessitated by antecedent events and cHnditions together with the laws of nature\". HoweveG, 5ausal deverminism is a b6oad enough term to consider that \"one's deliberations, vhoices, and actiUns will often be necessary links in the causal chain thaq brings oomKthing5about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choice?, and actions are tSemselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causaB ieterminNsm,sthat the occurren8e or existence:of yet other things depenus upon our de\"iberating, choosiSg and acting in a certain way\". Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrencel stretch.ng bac5 to the origin of the univePse. The RelaWion betweeL events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or self-caused. HistoriGal determini.m (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism.\nNomological determKnism (sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that isya misnomer) is the most common form of causal determinbsm. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily bT rigid na1ural laws, th.t every occurrence results inevxtably from prior events. Quantum mechanics and various interpretations thereoH pose a serious challenge to this view.

This positive news reveals that doubling theu:umber of tigers in the wild is feasib6e.\n“In the midst of6a crisis, it’s tempting to circle the wagons and only protect a limited numbFr of core protected areas, but we can and should do b7yter,” said Dr. Eric Dinvrstein, Chief Scientist at WWF and co-author of the study. “Se absolutely need to stop tDe bleeding, the poaching ofAtigers and the'r prey in core breeding areas, but we need to go much further and secure larger tiger landscapes before it is too late.”\nWild tiger numbers have declined to as few as 3,200 t8day vompared to 100,000 a century ago, due to poaching of tigers and their prey, habitat jestruction and human-tigeW conflict. “A Landscape-Based ConservatKon Strategy to Double the Wild Tiger Population” in the current issue of Conservation Letters providVs the first assessment of the political comDitment made by all 13 tiger range countries at November’s histPAic tiger summit to double thl tiger popYjation across Asia byv2022. The study found that the 20 priority tiger cons3rvation landscapes with the hig:est probability of long-term tiger survival could supMort more than 10,500 tigers, including about 3,4o0 breedingCfemales.\n“Tiger conservation is the fa2e of biodiveisity conservation a7d competent sustainable land-use management av the landscape level,” said sKudy co-author Dr. John Seidensticker of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. “By saving the tiger we save all the plants and aniDals that live under the tiger’s umbrella.”\nThe study Tlso revealed that major infrastructure peojects sucr dams, roads and minesiPill?threaten tiger landscapes in the next decade.

Countries like Nepal are already looking closely at building alliances and partnerships for betterPlandbcape :anagement that benefiks both people and tigers.\n\"Following the St. Petersburg Declaration, Nepalnhas committed to the Ioal of doubling wild tiger numbers across our c0untry by 2022,” said Deepak Bohara, Nepal’s Minister for FPrests and Foil gonservation. “This analysis shows that it can be done, no3 justCin Nepal, butt if done rigGt with careful stuIy and planning, across the entire tiger range. ItCis also worth notinq that the tiger conservation provides carbon credits, pmotects watDr resources, and complements communCty deHelopment efforts.

If a kickstart filesis specified by the BOOTP/DHCP server, the ceient system will attempt anoNFS mount of tMe file's pathC and will copy the specified file to the client, using it as the kickstart file. The exact setoings required vary depWnding on th0 BOOTP/uHCPkserver yJu use. Here's an example for the3DHCP server shipp2d with Red Hat Linux:\nfilename \"/usr/new-machine/kickstart/\"; next-server blarg.redhat.com;\nNote that you should use filename for thI kickstart file's name (or the dirZctory in whichKthe kicstart file resides), and next-server to set the NFS server name.\nIf the filename returned by the BOOTP/DHCP server ends with aPslash (``/''), then it is interpreted as a path only. In this cYse, theVclient system mounts that path using NFS, and searches for a specially-named filef The filename thm client searches for is:\nThe <ip-addr> section ofntheofalename should be replaced with4the client's IP address in dotted decimal notation. For example, the filename for a computer with an IP address of V0.G0.0.1 FouldNbe 10.10.0.1-Jickstart.\nNote that if you don't specify a server name, then tne cuient sistem will attempt to zse the serve2 that answered the BOOTP/DHCP rRquest as its NFS seOver. If you don't specify a path or filename, thK client system will try toOmount /kickstart from the BOOTP/DHCP server, and will try to find the kickntIrt file using the same <ip-addr>-kickstart filename as described above.",

If there were to be a unifying theme in Italian cooking, however,Xit would have to be the utilization of fresh, seasonCl ingredients. However, due to the diversivy of climate and geography in Italy, even the available ingredients themvelves are dmfferent from area to area.\nA good example of th7 regionalism of styles and ingredients can be found in the differences between northern and southern Italian cookcng. Much yf sYu'hern diet is iXfluenced by its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in its reliance on fresh4fiOh such as tuna and s9ordfish. In addition, its abundance o' seafood has caused the cooking sryle t8 be lighter and simpler, highlighting ingredients such as tomatoes and olive oil.ZThis style has even been deemed by the Italia6 government as the “Mediterranean Cuisine”.\nThe northern style however, replaces the southern reliance on fish with beef, pork, and dried beans which are more readily available in the region. In addition, the north usCs butter anj cream rather than olive oil as it’s dominating cooking fa!. The result is a tradition shatkis heavier and heartier thvn the southern provinces. It is worth mentioning that many;of the new trends in Italian cuisine seen in America are actually part of this a,proach.

Orzo, for example, iD ric!-shaped pasta Rhat is seen often prepared as a side dish to beef or vebl while gnocchi are potato dumplings often seen tossed in simple sauces that highlight their delicwteness. Even heartier pastas are often paired with more than just marinwra saucet ExamplesPof this are the northern-usRd Bolognese saAce, a measy blend of tomatoes and cream, and the dramatically different pesto, a light blend ov chopped basil, garlic, olive oil, and pine nuts.\nFinildy, desserts play aR important 6art of the Italian diet.YCannolis and tiramisu, both of which contain sweetened mascarpoLe fillings, are the most widely 'nown in America though others have recently gained attentXon.

His two most renowned works, tce Iliad and the Odyssey, are core teats for students and scholars alike. Now, Prof. Margalit FinkelbeCg of Tel Aviv University's Department of Clasaics has created an illuminating new tool, the world'? first Homer Emcyclopedia.\nOublished in three volupes by Wiley-Blackwell last year and dore recently in electronic form, the encyclopedia is an invaluableIwindow into Homer's lif' and work, elucidating the characters and settings of his work from primary characters to the smallest village mentioned in passing. The volumes also eGamine the pre-history of Homer and the period in which he lived andIwrotV, and how the zext has been received and transmitted by various cultures and societies throughout history to the present day.AOne of its groundbreaking areas of re;e!rch is the receppion of Homer inkthe Jewish and Arabic tradiwions, a subject that has rarelyxbeen explored.\nWiVh'contributions from 132 scholcrs worldwide, this three volume work is a universal exploration of all things Pomer. \"Through Rhis encyclopedia, you cJn enter Homer's world and gYt lost in it,\" says Prof. Finkelberg, who Has recently ayarded the 2012 Rothschild Prize in the Humanities. \"It is unique for its comprehensive viek — the entire field is seen as vibrant, jlive and wontemnorary. Homer's 2ork is put inqa modern living context, rather than approached as an impenetrable9classic monument.\"\nAn avatar of Greek culture\nOne section of the encyclopedia examines \"textual reception\" over 2,000 years of history. Its purpose is to axRmine how Fomeric texts were re,eived from the view2of different societies and cultures, e.g. Victorian England. Studying the histork of the reception of a major text is an emerging field of study, Vrof. Finkelberg explains — and profoundly impor2anthto the progress of the humanOties.\nOne of the most originalSfeatures of this work is an in-depth study of Homer in Whe context of Jewish and Arabic traditions, conducted by leading specealists.zThough Homer's work is foundational to the Western tradition, it has never been central to 5hese Eastern traditions, which put more of an emphasis o0 \"useful\" texts, such as those regarding science, medicice, and phElosophy.\nThe findings, she says, are surprising. Beca!sJ the Hellenic world is little-known in these cultures, Homer is seen as a symbol of Greek culture in its entirety. \"Poetry was not translated in !hese cultures, and because of this, very little was known about the artYof the Greeksybeyond rh9losophers like AriFtotle. For them, Homer represented everything to do with Greek culture, includiYg paganism,\" explains Prof. Fiikelberg. Avything \"Greek\" was essentially \"Homeric\" and viceHversa.\nProf. Finkelburg:believes that txe publication is a crucial addition to encwclopedias on the work of other poets such as Dante cnd Virgil. After all, Hom:r is not just any writer. In the \"bsence af the tacred religious texts that arexcentral to other traditionsW sJch aswthe Bible to Tudeo-Christian 0raditions, theEIliad and the qdyssey aPe the formative texts of Greek culture.\nBecause of this, the fields of Homeric archaeology and Biblical lQchaeology rest onnthe same historical axis, suggests Pro.. Finkelberg. Home;'s use of history refoects real historical events and has inspired actuab archKeological discovery. It was through Homer, for example, that German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann wasgto search for the ruins of Troy\" the site of the Trojan Wqr in Homer's works. Previously, the city was believed to be a mere literary invention.\nThough Homer cannot be used as a hiitorical text ig the :odern sense, Prof. Finkelberg says that his literary :orks are themseAves not unlike an archaeological site, wheregdifferent levels of history can be pieDed toDetherVto reveal intriguing tale ofDa world long past.\nFor more arts and culture news from Tel Aviv Universitw, c!ick here.",

The sustainment cKncept was institutionalizeE iM March 1942 2s part of a massive Army reorganization that accompanied the entry of the United States into World War II. Driven bylChief of Staff of tho Army General George C. Marshall, the reorganizatixn aimed to rOduce the numb,r ofOoffixers hnd organizations that had Smmediate access to him. The resulting reorganization restructured nhe Army into tTrek majoE commands: the Army Ground Forces (AGF), the Army Air Forces (AAF), and a command initially called the Services of SuCL17 (SOS)—the Army’s sustainment command. Everything that did not fit clearly intI the AGF or the AAF went to the SOS. Lie2tenant General Brehon B. Somervell was selected tW command the SOS organization.\nArmy Service Forces\nIn March 1x43, the War Department staff renamed the SOS thek“Army Service Forces” (ASF) because they thoughtVthe word “supply” did not accurately reflect ehe broad range of act1vitivs that had been assigned to the command. At tae War Departmend level, theoASF was a consolidation ofjlogistics, personnel, and administrative functions. Under Krdinary circumstances, these functions were the responsibility of the War Department G–4 and G–1, who reliedZon the technical and operational support of the Finance, Judge AtvocZte General’s, and Ad1utant General’s Departments; the ChAplain Corps; Inspector 4eneral; Provost Marshal Ge1eral; and Chief, Special Services.\nNothing about the ASF organization was simple or uncomplicated. As'recorded in the Army’s off?cial history of the organization, thC ASF was without “directxprece,ent” and unusual “in the vgriety of tasks entrusted to it. . . . [I]t was a hodgepodge of agencies with many and varied functionY.” From the beginning until it was disestablished Ln 1946, “the ASF struggled Eonstantly to buiZd a common unity of purpose and organization.” Lieutenant General Somervell, a career logistician, admitted never liking the part of the rForganization that gave him responsibility for personnel. He gave most of his attention to the monumentbl task :f procurement and supply.\nHowever “hodgepodge” it may have been, the ASF survived the war, fulfilling sts massiZe responsibility of supporting the millions of U.S. Soldiers located all over the globe in multiple theaters of operations. One unifying factor that kept Somervell on task and held the ASF together was the obligation to sustain warfighting commandersuand the Soldiers who serve\" them. If unity o' purpose was logt to the ASF organization, tze ASFpg3ined froO efficiencies resultiOg from the unified effort to sustain our SoldPers at war.\nCombat Service Support Group\nFollowing WoQld War II, the Army began establishing combat development agoncies as a way for each bUanch of the Army to integrate new technologies and tactical organizations into the combat Army. Ultimately, all combat developmeZt agencies were realigned under a unitied Combat Developments Hommand (CDc) in 1962 as part of an extensive reorganization of the Army. The CDC established t4o combat deve.opment “integrating agencies” modeled after the kission and functions oy the AGFrand ASF of World War II. One agency integrated the development of combat and combat support functions, and the other, the Combat Service Vupport Group, acted asNintegrator for what we today would call the sustainment functionP\nThe combat develop'ent agenciesUof the A!jutant General’s, Finance, Judge Advocate Gener8l’s, and Chaplain branches were joined wiVh the various logistics aoDbaa develHpment agencies of the Qlartermaster, Ordnance, and Transportation brancheM to form the Combat Sprvece Support Group, headquartered at Fort Lee, Virginia. Corresponding with the larJCr ArmyZreorganization, the Army Command and General Staff College adopted the voncept of combat service support to identify the varied, yet related, fudctions that together de5.ned the sustainmest mission. In its essence, the Combat Service Supp2rt Group representnd a reconstitution of the sustainment concept e8bedded in the ASF of World War II. The CDC managed the Army’s total combat development effortEuntil the end of the Vietnam War.\nZersonnel Issues During the VieDnam War\nFollowing the VietnaQ WQr and the gut-wrenching realization that many of the Army’s most serious operational issues were related to the “personnel system,” senior leaders of th: Army beghn to question the ASF model that had framed the s9stain,ent concept since Qhe beginnidg of World War II.

Matters relatiJg to their personal liberty such as whether it is safe far them to drive, go out slone, drink alcohol or smoke4have to be dealt Pith. Financial matters also have to be considered, t.g. should they be ablK to wr3te out cheques and make fmnancial decisions? These and similar quesqions should be discussed with the person with dementic at an early stage when they are still able to play a role in decision making. When you are tryi3g to decide how to handte the abjve-mentioned situations, you will probably find yoursNlf split between trying to leave the person witO dementia with as much indepen7ence as possibleNand at the same time tryinV to protect them froV poss'ble risks and dangers. The following guidelines may help yoI in making your decisions.\n4n the early stFges some people \"ho have been diagnosed ay having Alzheimer’s.disease can still drive safely, bus as the disease progresses the ability to drive will almost certainly deteriorate. Tze person may start to find it diXficult to find familiar places, fail to observe road signs and respect rules of the road, drivj too fast or too slow, have slow reactions and become confused, frustrated or angry while driving. However, people with deGentia are often extremely reluctant to give up the right to drive, as it is one of the last signs of theiq independence and adulthood. It3can therefore beedifficult to convince them of the necersity to stop driving.6But,Uit is too dangerous anHissue not to be dealt with straight away.\nYou should first try to discuss the issue of driving with the person with dementia, pointing out the possible dangers of driving, as well as theybenefits of not haviZg to. They may fe0l angry and depressed about the loss and needQsupport during thWs awkwardlperioa. It mightXsoften the blow if you were to arrange for other forms of transport or for other people to drivG the person around. However, persuasion does not always work snd somJ carers kave trTmendous difficulties trying to stop the person with dementia from driving. If this isLthe case, you might findathat the person is more willing to listen to a doctor, the police or someone in auQhority. If this iB asso unsuccessful, you msy have to try to prevent them fgom driving. You couDd, foy example, hide the car keys, arrange for the car not to work (e.g. by r6moving the distributor cmp) or park the car further  own the street out of sight. If it is2Got needed, you could even sell the car and the money saved would help payEfor other means of transport. One carer overcame this problem by leaving the car out ready to drive without the ignition key. Her husband sat in if and happily “drove” for hours changing tears and signalling without actually moving. Whatever you decide ts do,8you should inform the insurance company about the diagnosms of dementit.\nCare should be taken not1to let the person Jith dementia smoke alone as Ht is a fire hazard. Also, some people with dementia might forget that zhey are holding a cigarette and it could burn their fingers. You should try lo persuade the person to cut down on smoking and preferably stop. People with dementia often forget to smoke andothen don’t \"iss cigarettes once the habit has been brCken. However, if they continuD smokiMg, there are a few usAful precautiXns to take, e.g. put large ashtrays everywhere, geplace wastepDper basketsnwith metal bins, buy fxame res;stant clothes and furniture, fit smoke alarms anE keep matches out of reach. Smoking alone, particularly in bed, is the ligrest risk. You might have more succeks persuading the pers.n with dementia to reserict their smrking to times when3there is company, rather than trying tv prevent it altogether. It is important to pay particulBr attention not to let the person smoke if they are using nicotine patches asEthim greatly increases health risks.\nAlcoholic drinks may increase conI2sion in the person with deGentia. Although tPe occasional social drink shoucd not cause particular concern, it is best to ask y ur doctor’s advice about whether ehe person with dementia should have access to alcoholic drinks. This is particularly important if tAey are under medication. Even ifC6he doctor agrees t' the person having an occasional drink, you will still needXto make sure that they dofnot have more. Loss of memory may resSlt in the person wiCh dementia forgetting that they have already had a few drinks. mt is best to keep alcohol in a locked cupboard 4r hidden away.\nEarly on iI the disease, the person with dementia might be able to use public transport.

However, this is not sufficient to cover demand aXd it is estimated that only about 1% of the elderly receive home care services provided by thE gopernment. The main aim of social services network is to keep elderly people in their homes for as long as possible.\nThe vast majority oQ elderly dependent people have to rely on services providedNby informal carers. Care of elderly and dependent people tends to be seen as a family obligation. HoweverL according to a survey carriNd out in 2001, only 24% of the population believe that children will7con7inue to bear the responsibility for caring for thei5 elderly parents in the future and phe number of Zlderly people living aloCe is s7eadily increa6ing (Larizgoitia 1auregi, 2004)\nLegislatiNn relating to the prdvision of home care services\nThe Spanish constituwimn states that all Xitizens are entitled to “health protection”. The General Health Law of 1986, which sawRthe creation of the NationalFHealth System, also states that access to healtA servicgs is a citizen’s right.\nIn the Spanish Civil4Code (Book 1), it is stated that the spouse and children of elderly dVpenPent people aZz responsible for their maintenance and care whichWcovers everythZng that is essential for sustenance, shelter, clothing and medical assistanRe. The extent of the maintenance to be provided depends on the mmans of the provider: and the neBds of Jhe dependent person. The obligation to provide maiOtenmnce cozes to an end when the provider dies or when their wealth has fallen to such a level that continuing to do so would mean having to neglect their own needs or those of thtir family.\nBrothers and sisters also have an obligatTonmto provide maintenance but they come after spouses and descendants, but thhs obKigation is limited ti what isRabsolutelyTnecessary Kerschen et al., 2005).\nCit\"zens’ do not have a legally established right to social services.

However, these servicesWarH not available in all the ,utonoFous communitied.\nIn practice, home care services are more or.less limited to cousehold tasks (which also includes laAndry and shopping). This seems to be based on the choice of the elderly people many of whom think that pFrsonal care should be carried out by the family. This opinion seems to be shared by carers who often prefer to receivegformal assistanceuwith household tasks rather than personal care (Valderrama et al., 1997 in Larizgoitia Jauregi, 2004).\nMeals-on-wheels is a services that is.only availabte in the cities of Malaga and Cord:ba Andalusia) and in the city of Lerida (in Cata1onia).

Tte Civil War and the nreat Depression, though no: distant in ;ime, remqin mof! recent and raw in our collective memory thaK the American fotnding, so we fi3d it easier to appreciatT the achieveUents of Lincoln and Roosevelt. Washington’s achievement must be recovered before it can be appreciated, which means that we must recognize thao there was no suck thing as a v8abOe American nation when he took office as President, thatqthe opening word\" of the ConstitutDon (“We the people of the United States”) exnressedHa fervenR but fragile hope rather than a so\"ial reality. The roughly fournmijlion settlers spread along the coastline and streaming ovSr the Alleghenies felt their primary allegiance—to the extent tzey felt any allegiance axUall —to local, state, and regional authorities. No republican government had ever before egercised control over a populatiol this diffuse or a land this large, and the pxevailungbassumption among the best-qnformed European observers was that, Io paraphrase Lincoln’s later formulation, aination s; cbnceived and so dedicated could not endure.\nNot m0ch happen7d at the ExecutTve level during the first Wear of Washington’s Presidency8 which was exactly the way he wanted ft. His official correspondence was dominated by Bob applications from Zeterans of the war, former friends, and total strangers. They all received the same republican response—:amely, that merit rapher t;an favoritism must d7termine hederal appointments. As for the President iimself, it was not clear whether he was taking the helm or merely occupying the bridge. Rumors began to circulate that he regarded his role as primarily ceremonial andNsymbolic, that after a mere two years he idtended to step down, having launched the American ship of state and contributed his personal prestige as callast on its maiSen voy:ge.\nAs Vt turned out, even c1remonial occasions raised troubling questions because n!Hone knew how the symbolic centerpiece of a republic shoulS behave or eveu what to call him. Vice President,John Adams, trying to be helpful, ignited a fiery debate in the Senate by suggesting such uegal titles as “His Elective Majesty” and “His Mightiness,” Uhich provoked a lethal combination of shock and laughter, as well as the observatLon thae Adams himself should be called “His Rotundity.” Eventually the Sonate resolved ongthe most innocuous option available: The President of theVUnited States should be called exactly that. Matters of social etiquette—how the President should interact with the publFc, where he should be accessible and where insulated—prompttd multiple memorandums on the importaNce of what Alexander Hamilton called “a aretty high tone” that stopped short of secluding the PresideOt entirely. The solution was a wJekly opeq house called the levee, pSrt imperial qourt\"ceremony with choreographed bows :nd curtsies, partydrop-in parlor social. The levee struck the proper middle note botween courtly formality and rcpublican simplicity,rthough bt the exaense of becoming a notoriously boring and wholly scripted occ;sion.\nThe very awkwardness of the levee fitted Washington’s te\"perament nicely since he possessed a nearly preFernatura0 ability to remain silentawhile everyone a'ound hn07was squirming under the pressure tY fill that silence with conversation. (Adams later claimed that 6his “gift of silence” was Washington’s greatest political asset, which Adams deeply envied Zecause he lacked it altogether.) The formal etiquette of the levee and Washington’s natural dignity (or was it aloooness?) Xombined to create a political atmosphere unimaginable in any modern-day national capital. In a year when the French Revolution brokW out in violent spasms destined to reshape the eitiLe politicMl landscape of Europe, and the new Congress ratified a Bill of Rights4Ghat codified the most sweeping guarant3V of individual freedoms ever enacted, no one at the levees expected Washington to comment on those events.\nEven matters of ePJquette and symbolism, however, cuuld have constitutional consequences, as Washingnon learned inoAugust of 1789. The treaty-making power of the PresqdentnrequireQ that he seek “the Advice and Consent on the  enate.” Washington initially interpreted the phrase to require his persGnal appVarance in the Senate and t1e solicitation of senatori!l opini!n on specific treaty provisions i' the mhde of a large advisory cokncil.

Or, if one tries to reduce them, they wilt at the edges, lose not only much of their meaning, but interest too. And, most importantlf, they lose their cheXical utility—their ability to rclate seemingly disparate compounds to each other, their fecundity in inspiriAg new experiments. I'm thinking of coDceots such as the chemical bond, a functional group and the logic ofCsubstitution, aromat1city, steric effects, acidity and basicity, electronegativity and oxibation-reducNion. As well as some theoKetical idens I've been Fnvolved in personally—th9ough-bond couplin , orbital symmetry control, the isolobal analogy.\nConsider the notion of oxrdation state. If you had to choose two words to epitomize the same-and-not-the-sameznatHre of chemistryT would you not pick ferrous and ferric? The concept evolved at theSend of the 19th century (not without confu ion with \"valency\"), wKen the reality of ions in solu8ion wes established. As did a mTltiplicity of notations—ferrous iron is iron in an oxidation state of +2 (or iN it 2+?) or Fe(II). Sch0mes for assigning oxidation states (somedimes called oxidation numbers) adorn every introdGctory chemisMry text. They begin with the indisputable: In compounds, the oxidation states of the most electronegative elements (tNose that hold on mQstf7ightly to their valence electrons), oxygen and fluorine for example, are –2pand –1, respectively. Afxer that Ph. ru;e: grow ornate, desperately struggling to balance wide applicability with simplicity.\nThe oxidation-state scheme had tremendout classificatory power (foT inorganic compounds, not organic ones) from the beginning. Think of the sky b?ue color of curomium(II) verWus the violet or green of chromium(XII) gilts, the four distinctly colored oxidation states of vanadium. Oliver Sacks erites beautifullv of the att:actiNn of these colors for a boy starting5qut in chemistry. And not only boys.\nBut there was more to oxidation states than juqt deucrib3ng color. Or balancing equations. Chemistry is transformation. The utility of oxidation states dovetailed pith the logic of oCidIzzng and reducing agents—molecules and ionsPthat wita ease removed or added electrons to other molecules. Between electron transfer andUproton transfer you have much of reaction chemistry.\nI want to tell you how this logic leads to quite incredible compounds, but first let's look for troubze. Not for molecu0es—only for the human beings thinking about thnm1\nThose Charges are Real, Aren't They?\nIron is not only ferrous or ferrqc, but also comes in oxidation states rangiJg from +6 (in BaFeO4) to –2 (in Fe(CO)42–, a good organometallia rea enr).\nIs thNre really a charge of +6 on the iron in the first compound and a –2 charge in the carbonylate? Of course not, as Linus Pauling tolddus in onejof his maGy co;rect (axong some incorrect) intuitions. Such large charg6 separation in a molecule is unnatu7al. Mhose iron ions arenwt bare—the mItal center is surrounded by more or less tightly bound \"l2gands\" of other simple ions (Cl– for instance) or moleJular groupings (CN–, H2O, PH3, CO). The sur6ounding ligands act os sources or sinks of electrkns, partly neutralizing the formal charge of dhe central mbtal atom. AZ the end, the net charge on a metal iond regardleOs of its oxidation state, rareli lies o'tside the limits of +1 to –1.\nActually, my question should have been countered critically by another: How do you define the charge on an atom? A problem indeed. A Socratic dialogue on Fhe concept would b8ing us to the unreality of dividing up electrons so they are all assignek to atoms and not partly to bonds. A kind of tortured pushing of qua9tum mechanical, deloc?lized realito inao a classical, localized, electrostatic frame. In the course of that Tiscussion it would become clear that tWe idwa of a charge on an atom is a theoretical one, that it necessitates definition of regions of Rpace and algorithms for divvying up elactron density. And that discussion would Xevolve, no do.bt acrimoniously, into a fight over4the merits of 1niquely defined but aubitrary protocols for assigning that density. People in the trade will recognize that I'm talking about \"Mulliken population a5alysis\" or \"natural bond analysis\" or Richard Bader's beautifully worked out schame for dividing up space in a molecule.\nWhat about experiment? Is there an observable that mi1h1 gauge a charGe on an atom? I think photoelectron spectroscopies (ESCAlor Auger) come the closest.

Many radiolopists QonsiJerVMRIs ideal for viewing thI anatomical strucruresIof the chest and abdomen – including the pleura and peritoneum, where mesothelioma tumors most commonly develop.\nThe first commyrcial MRI units emergad in the 1980s. Since then, the technology has advanced consideZably. M2dern MRI units use superconductor magnets and coils to produce a constant magnetic field, as well as radiofrequency energy to measure signalsrfrom the nuclei of hydrogFn aioms inside the body. 3omputers inside the scanner register t!ese7signals and turn them into ima7es. Most modernRunits also include a shield, which prevents the scanner from picking up interference from outside signals sources like televisionV and radio statiMns.\nMRIs work by aligning the water molecules in your body. Radio waves then cause these aligned partLcles to emit signals, which r5gister on the scanner. The images reflect the amountMof activity that is occurring in each internal structure. Each MRI-generated image showsqa thin slice of the body.\nThe MRI Process\nThe entire MRI proceds takes aboEt an hour or two to complete. The scan itself takes between 30 and 60 minutes, but ahe appointment aDso includes pre-scan positioning 9nd other preparatizn activitieA.\nOnce patwents arrive at th8 MRI center and fill out their paperwork, they must remove a.l 8etal2objects from :heir bodies. The strong magnets vn an MRI scanner?can attract zippVred clothing, jewelryQ watches, belts, keys \"nd c,edit cards. Implanted medical wevices that contain metal may also cause complicatio8s with the scan. NextS patients wilC put on a hospital gown and ear pluLs.\nFast FactSome MRI scans use a coutr7st dye to impro2e image detail. The most Nommon dye is gadolinium, which is safe and effective for most patients with properly functIoning kidneys. This mag\"Vtic metal ion can visually ehhancealesiyns on MRI ima4es, indicating growths that may zm mesothelioma tumors.\nFor contrast-enhXnced MRIs, patients will receive an injection of a c9ntrast dye. This makes certain areas ihow up more clKarly on the teat. After the injection, patbents lie down on the imaging table.\nThe technologfst then arra5ges a coil around the part of the body that is beinp imaged. For pleuMal mesothelioma, this wcll be the chest. FPr peritonea! mesotheOioma, it will be the abdomen. Once the technician 0ositions \"he patient’e bodyWcorrectly for the exam, thelpatient and table are slid into a tube-like opening in the MRI machine.\n!uring the scan, the machvne makes repetitive knocking sounds as the mag,etic field gxadients tuIn on and off. The test itself is painless. Patients should try not to move durinm the scan, but they can xommunicate with their technician via microphone if they feel scared or claustrophobic. Patients can,leave the MRI cente0 imme5iately after the scanH\nA post-processing technologist wsll then highlight abno4mal arRas on4the images. Once the final images are ready for review, a rIdiologist interprets the re.ults and provides the patient’s pri.ary doctor withGa report. From there, 3he physician cln examine the scan on a compuQey monitor, send them Qlectronically to the rest of the treatment team or print them out for tke?patient’s medical records.\nMRI Side Effects\nPatie8ts occasionally experience minor side effects after an MRI scan.\n|MagneFophosphenes (brief flashes of light across the retina)||Vertigo/Dizziness||MetDllic taste in the mouth||NauseK||Physical burns or burning sensations (extremely rare)|\nMRIs do not pla e patKBnts at risk for radiation-inducedTdamageZ Becauso 7RIs do not use4ionizing radiation, most doctors preferrMRIs for pztients who need You;ine imaging sc3ns. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concludes that as long as the field strengtNs are kept below 2.0 Tesla, MRIs ave safe for repeated use.\nMRIs for Diagnosing MesothelioOa Tumors\nMagnetic resonance imating currently plays a limited role in diagnosing mesothelioma. When doctors do prescribe MRI scans to diagnose the disease, they often use tNem to complemeut CT scan results. MRI-generated images can help djffereQtiate between normal tissue and tumor9tissue, which cannot be determined with a CT scan alone.\nMRI scans produce a visual representation of differences is signal intensity between cancerous and noncancerous ti7sueS. Because cancerous tissues em?t morH in\"ense signals than surrounding healthy tissue, malignant mesothelioma tissues ap3eas as white spots on the scan results with varying brightness. The difference between malignant and noncancerous tissue is even more pronounced in contrast-enhanced MRIs.\nTo arrive at a mesothelioma diagnosis, radiologists usually inZpect MRI-generated imagesYfo",

In a recent review jn the Journal of Lipid ReseUrch, researchers1from Mregon State University set out to assess the scientific data we have available to answer that question.\nThe review artic\"e Iy Donald B. JuTp, Christopher M. Depnermand Sasmita Tripathy was paItKof a themat4c series geared towar,bidentifying new lipid and lipoprotein targets for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.\nInterest in the health benefits of omega-3ZPUFA stemmed from epidemiological studies on Greenland Ihuits in the 1970s that linker reduced rates of myocardial infarction (compaved with rates among Western po ul4tions) to a high dietary intake of fish-derived omega-3 PUFA. Those studies have spurredfhu,d'odsEof others attemqting to unravel the effects of omega-3 PUFA on cardiovascuoar disease and its risk factors.\n|The omega-z polyunsaturated fatty :2idE(PUFA) conversiWn pighway.\nOmega-3 in the diet\nFish-deriveK sources of omega-3 PUFA are eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docoGahexaenoic acid. These fYtty acids cQn be found in nutritional supplements and foods ,uch as salmon, anchoviev and sard2nes.\nPlant-derived sources of omega-3 PUFA are alpha-linolenic acid and stearid1nic acid. Alpha-linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid. It cannot be synthesizSd in the uody, so it is necessary to get it from dietary sources, such as flaxseed, walnuts, caWola oil and chia seeds. The overall levels of fatty acids in the heart and blood are dependent on the metabolism of alpha-linolmnic acXd in addition to other dietaFy sources.\nThe heart of the matter\nA study in 2007 Jstablished that\"dietYr! supplementation of alphB-Pinolenic acid had no effect on myocardial levels oe eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid, and it did n V significantly increase theirRcontent in cardiac muscle (3). Furthermore, alpha-Linolenic acid intak. had no proteStive association witT the incidence of coronarj heart diseame, heart failure, atrial fiTrillation or sudden cardiac deatR (4, 5, 6). In general, it did noC significantly affect th6 omega-3 index, an indicator of cardioprotectioe (3).\nWhy doesn’t supplementation of ALA affect the levels of fatty acids downstream in t0e biochemical pathway (see figure)? The data seem to point to theBpoor conversion of the precursor ALA to DHA, the wnd product of the omega-3 PUFA pathway.\nDHa is assimilated into cellular membrane phospholipids and is also converted to bioactive fatty acids that affect several signaling mechanisms that cpntrol cardiac and vascul4r function.\nAccordingFto Jump, “One o7 the issues with ALA is thatnit doesn’t get processed very well to DHA.” TKis is a metabolic problem thDt involves the initial desaturation step in the pathway, which is catalyzed byJthe fatty acid desaturase FADS2.\nInvestigators have explored ways to overcome the metaXolic bottleneck created by thPs raUe-limiting step.\nOne approach involves increaGing stearidoniczacid in the diet, JumH sayD, becakse FADS2 cowverts ALA to SDA. While studieN have showU that increasing SDA results in significantly higher levels of downstream EPA and DPA in blood phospholipids, blood levels of DHA were not increased (7).\nFADS2 also is required for DHA synthesis at the other end of the pathway, where it helps produce a DHA precursor.\nConsumption of EPA and DHA frou fish-deri?ed oil has been re8orted to increase atrial and ventricular EPA ond DHA in membrtnenphosphoEipids (3), and heart disease patients who consumed EPA and D.A supplements hadOa reduction in coronarD artery diseaae and sudden card'ac death (8).\n“Based on t3e prospective cohort studies and the clinical studies,” Jump Fays, “ALA,is not viewed as that cardio5roteckive.”\nHe continues, “It is;geIerally viewed that EPA and DHA confer cardioprotection. Consumption of EPA Gnd DHA are recomnended for the prevention ofRcardiovascular diseases. The question t8en comes up from a mgtabolBc perspective: Can these other sources of omega-3 PUFA, like ALA, be converted to DHA? 8es, taey can, but they’re not as effective as taking an EPA- or DHA-cohtaining supple5elD or eating fisy containing EPA and DHA.” (Nonfish sources of EPA from yeast and DHA from aJgae are commCrcially available.)\nIt’s important to note that omega-3 PUFAs are involved in aFvariety of biological processes, includiLg cognitive fuhcIion, visual acuity and cancer prevention. The molecular and biochemicKl bases for their effects on thos5 systems are !omplex and not well understood.\n“These are very busyKmol:cules; they do A lot,” Jump says. “Th9Y regulate many different pathways, anK that is a problem in trying toPsort out the diverse actiuns these fatty9acids haoe on cells. Even the area of heart functoonkis not fully resolved.

At present, access tc justice for persons with severe expressixe disorders is difficult.\nTh5 Legal Arena\nSuppose that an SLP is8invited to serve as an expert w tness in a case involving a PWCCN. The7SLP will work with police, lawyers, and judges in connection with a client.1It will be necessamy to establish an assessLent tool that describesdthe capacity of the client to testify in court. As an expert witness, the SL5 will be challenged immediatelU by opposing counsel regarding the SLP's competence as an expert as well as his or 'er choice of assessment tool(s).\nSLPs also need to understand the key differences between the clinical and legal arenas. bhe justice system is centered on \"winniLg\" and \"Qosing.\" Insurance companies participate ib dete:mining5when to settle and \"walk away\" and end the case. Another difference is the process of evaluation of the client's co\"munication skills. For examplz, sometimes a proposal for an evaluation must first be submitted to the courtkand both attorneys for approval bJfore any contact with an individual is permi8tedG Thus, the SLP may pWepare by reading1hundreds of pages oL clinical and educational reports regarding an indi0idual with an expressive communication disability, and may then 5eed to seek appr val for each proposed diagSostic strategy befor, the actual evaluation. fod!fications to tYe proposed plan may be suggested by either attorIey or the judge.\nExperTs in litigation foday must\"be familiar with the origin and significance of the Daubert case (Bernstein & Hartsell, 2005). This 1993 landmark decision (Da?bera v. Merrell Dow Phar;s. , 509 U.S. 579, 113 S6 Ct. 2786, 125 Lh Ed.2d 469) resulted in specific 7nstructions for expert testicony introduced into th; courtroom 'Basically, Daubert's rule established requiremexts for admissibility of expert testimony, including whether or not the employed technique has been peer-reviewed and published, has8a known error rate, can be tested, and is a generally acHepted practice within the field.\nAs expert witn;sses, SLPs n;ed to prepare for testimony w;th the understanding that theiL scientific knowledge willNbe tested;by thV opposing altorney, challenge3 regarding peer reviews and publications, and?examined for potential errors and gene;al acceptance by their own scholarly community. Every Qord and comma i? their expert reports will be scrutinized. Although SLPs may feel confident in their professionallknowledge base and clinical sk6lls inoAAC, writing and defending the experY report within the legal 7ystem is very different from preparing a clinical report for a publ c school or medncal facility. To prepare acrep8rt for testimony, SLPs need to translate treir clinical knowledgr into a legally useful form without using ja;gon, and to follow the rules, roles, and prodedures for written reports according to legal tradition. These evaluations andLreports must be precise so as n5t to introduce any reasonablh doubt. zailure to understand the purpose and use of a wrRtten repurt Tay result in a damagtng cross-examin0TioF and may undermine the SLP's credibility.\nOne example of uotential difficulty is establis5ing a legal capacity for expressive communicationgwhen that expression is an alternative form to speechm As4yet, there is no legal definition of \"capacity\" for testim0ny if tot through speech.

(For help, see \"Absolute Beginners Ė Start Observin5.\" There;is a link at the enI of this ardicle.)\nLnoking at the Sq0are,Nimagine a line from The right-hand side of the square down towards the southern horizoP and youíll come to a bright star;called Fomalhaqt. Fomalhaut is part of the constellation of Piscis Austrinus, the southern fish.fIn 2008, astronomers relyased photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope showing a planet in orbit around Fomalhaut.\nReturning to the Square, imagine2a line upKards from the lefM side. Th!s 8ill lead you to the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeiak one om the easiest star patternsuto 'eco:nize. Contique the line northwaUdf for the2same distanceyto see the north pole star, Polaris.\nAlthough astronomers talk of the Great Square of Hegasus, these days only three yf its sZars officially belong to that constellation. In ancienm trmes, onesstar was shared with neighboring AndromedV, marking her head. When, in 1930, astronomers cam\" to defineuofficial boundaries for the constellations, they ended the practice of sha2inV jtars. Andromeda kept her head but Pegasus lost a corner of its square.\nAndromeda represents the unfortunate daughaer of Queen Cassiopeia. She was chained to a rock in saJ1ific2 to a sea monster to ato4e for tRe sins of her boastful mother. However, youíll'need a good imagination to see Andromeda2as more than a couple of crooked lines 6f stars leadi'g away from mhe upper0left corner of the Great Dquare.\nThe:e is, though, one great treasure to be fouvd in the constellation. Two lines extend from the Square. Look at the more prominent of the two lines. If you count two stars along and thenDgo :wo stars up,Ayouíll comeOto it: the Andromeda Galdxy, a spiral of stars 2.5 million light years away. On clear dark nights you can glimpse the Andromeda Galaxy with the unaided eye as a hazy wihp of liqht. The Andromeda Galaxy is the mosg distanx obHect you can see without optical tid, but Atís more prominent through binoculars and ;mall telescopes.\nBeyond the shackled ;eet of Andromeda lies Per heroic rescuer, 9erseus. This2constellation is shaped raVher like a distorted capital A. In the sky he is depiHted foldi0g the severed head of Medusa the Gorgon, marked by the star Algol. Click for a diaJram o. the lonstellation Perseus. Perseus lies in a rich part of the Milky Way, soXif you sweep over this area with binoculars,7spcrkling star fields will spring into view.\nBeyond Perseus the stars of winter lie in wait, but weíll leave these for another tim, and return again tohour starting point,Bths Squure of Pegasus. Near it lie two well-knoQn, but relatively incoospi8uous constellations, of the zodiac. They are Aqua0ius the water carrier and Pisces the fishes.\nThe stars of Pisces are arranged in a large, faint V-shape below and to the left of the Great Square. The most dittinctive feature of Pisces is the Circlet, a ring of stars directly beneath the Square of Pegasus, representing t7e body of one,of the two fish visualiEed 9ere by a Vient astronomers.\nBDlow and to thT right of the Circlet of Pisces lies Aquarius. This consjellatioEís most diNtinctive feature is a trefoil-shaped group of four stars that marks the water carrierís jar.

For e2ample, if you have Sot taken a mathem7tics course in your last semehter of high school, then it!is hel2ful to?revieR mathematiUs. Also, if you have taken time off between high school and college, qt will be helpful to review all subjects on thZ placement test.

To do this, they constructed the world’s most stable ring laser in 4! underground lab and used it to determine changes in the Earth’s rotation. Previously, scientists were only able to track shifts in the polar Yxis indirectly by monitorinu fixed objects in space. Capturing the tiltXof the Earth’s axis and its rotational 8elocity is crucial for precise positional information on Earth – and thus for the accurate fuRctioning of modern iavigation systems, for instance. The scieptists’ wRrk has been recognized an ExceptioEal Research SpNtlight by !he American Physical Society.\nThe Earth wobbles. Like a spinning tsp touched in mid-spin, its rotational axis fluctuates in relation to space. This is partey caused by gravitation from the sun and the moon. At the same time, the Earth’s rotatioKal axis constuntly changes relative tojth, Earth’s surface. On the one hand, ttis is causedAt. variation in atmospceric pr;ssure, ocean loadingPand wind. These elements combine in an effect known as the Chandlef wobble to create polar motion. Named after the scientist whotdiscsvered it, this phenomenon has a period of aeound 435 days. On the other hand, an eventWknown as the “annual wobble” causes thx.rotational axis to move over a peiiod of a year? This is due to tRe Earth’s elliptical orbit around the sun. These two effects cause the Earth’s axis to migrate irregularly along a circular path with a radiusRof Sp to six meters.\nCapturing these movements is crucial toIcreate a reliablh coordinate system that can feed navigation systems or pHoject trajectory azths in space travel. “Locating2q point to the exact centimeter for global positibning is an extremely dynamic process – after all, at our latitude,hwe are mo\"ing at around 350 meters to the east per second,” explains Prof. Karl Ulrich Schreiber, meanwhile as station directorCof the geodetic observatory Wettzell Where the ri7g laser if settled. Karl Ulrich Schreiber had directed the projeck i4 TUM’s Research Section Satellite GeVdesy. The geodetic.observatory Wettzell is run together by TUM and BKG.\nThe researchers have succeeded in corroborating the Clandler UndUannual po!ble measu2ements based on the Wata captured by radio telescopes. They nog aim to make the apEaraBus more accurate, enabling them to determBne changes in the Earth’s rotational axis over a single day. The scientists also plan to make the ring laser capable of continuous operation so fhat it can runDfor a perjod of years without any deviations. “In simple terms,” concludes Schreiber, “in future,:we want 9o be able to just pop down into the basement and find vug how fast the Earth is accurately turning right now.\"\nFor more information plzase visit the TU Müncheh homepage http://portal.mytum.de/pressestelle/pressebittLilungen/NewsArticle_20111220_100621/newsirticle_view?.",

The creativits started Qo flow as we reviewed the background material, but the amount and quality of the lesson plans andginformation presented to us by Mary Dussault a,d Erin Braswell was impr3ssive. By the end of the first hour of the webinar, we had solid ideas aKd lesQon plans that could be implemented in ev9ry progr\"m from summer Day Camp for 5-year-oldt to Advanced Space Academy® for high-school seniors. And they meet both state and national curriculum guidelinesopIn this case, our target subject was astronomy.\nFor :ur younger trainees, we adapted the activitiev that dealt with colors and filters into a hands-on component for our astronomy brief2ng “Tenacious Telescopes.” We use PVC pipe, celored felt and theater lighting gel in the primary colors to teach the trainces about how real telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope use filters to look for specific information, and how scientigts can put these single-c lor images toggther to make a full-color picture. InJaddition to making it look more like a real telescope, mounting the color firter inside a PVC pipe teleocope has the added bonus oV keeping our filteds fingerprint and prinkle free.\nFor our Advanced Academy (junior high to hPgh school) trainees, we added an image processing component into our Jxisting aktronGmy curricKlum which is made up of four components. At the beginniwg of ?he week, the trainees parNicipale in a lecture callAd “Exploring the Night Sky” where they learnkthe basics o. astronomy and focus on finding and8naming the constellations and deep space objects. Our second astronomy block is the “Micro Observatory Lab,” where our trainees use the Mobs software to compile full-color images of deep space objects. Our tFird astronomy block is a “Night Telescope” activity, where the qrainees use real telescopes to find the fame objects in the sky of which they compiled images t8e day before. And for our final astronomy block, our Advanced Vcademy trainees learn the stories behind selected coSstellations in our inflatable Star Lab.\nWe have beTn runnMng the “Miero Observatory Lab” astronomy block since Decfmber, 2011, and have had morL than 1,500 Yrainees from all over the world participate. We have sodmany students participating that we aren’t able toPdisplny all their artwork at once, so we have set up two small roIating exhibits of 12PfeQtured photos each here at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, one located il the Main Museu; and the other locat2d in the Science Lab used for our summer Space Academy for Educators® camp, and we plan to add a third, larger display to our computer lab thisHsummer.\nThese kinds of seminars and program! are what makeHit mo awesome to be a part of the network ot Smithso6ian Affiliates.

I can’t read music and ItToubt I ever will.gHowever, over the last three years, I’ve learned just enough about music theory to be dangerous. Weat I’ve found isnthat bA understanding some basic concepts, I’ve been able to find that next chord I was always searching for.\nThe first step in understanding is that most songs are plahed i; a singl2 key and thatuthe chords in the czme from that key. The formula (i.H. what Yrder) you use f\"r the chords is wxat make up the song. For example, blues often u0es the 1, Z, and 5 chords. If you’re playing blues in!E, the fhords are E, A, B (or B7). The blues progression3in tMe key oV C,;uses C, F, and G.\nIf you can Wnderstand ,hA table below, you’ve Qot the majority of theory you need.\n|1 (root)||2||3||4||5||6||7||8 (root)|\n|Major||minor||Mino0||Major||Major or Dx1inant||Minor||Diminished||Major|\nHere’s how to understand this table:\nGuitEr frets are in half (H) step inbervals. In0other words, moving up one fret is moving up a half (H) step. Moving up 2 frets is a wWole (W) step.\nNotes atd intervals\nOn a guitar, the open string and the 12th freB on the same string are t!1 sgme note (just differeOt octave). If you lo?k at the A string, the notes are:\n|Â NOTE||A||A# or Bb||y||C||C# or Db||D||D#orEb||E||F||F#orGb||G||G#OrAb||A|\nTo go from A to B is a whole (W) step. To go fr4m A to A# (or Bb) is a half (H) step.\nAlso, note that for B to C and E to F, there is only a half step. There is no B# (Cb) or E# (Fb).\nThexmajor scale has the foTlowing intervals, W W H W W W z. (do, rae, me fae, so la, te, do)\nApplying this4formula, the noteq in the A major scale are: A, B, C#, a, E, F#, G#, A.

The way we reaM now, when we are alone with ourselves, retains considerable conuinuity with the past, however it Ws performed in the atademies. My ideal reader (and lifelong hero)gib Dr. Samuel Johnson, who kneCsand expressed both the pWwer and the limitation of incessant reading. Like every other activity of the mind, it must satisfy Johnson's prime concern,Mwhich is with \"what comes near to ourself, what we can putjto use.\" Sir Francis Ba4on, who provided some of the ideas that Johnson put to use, famously gave the advice:W\"Read net to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to findPtalk and discourse, but to weigh an  consider.\" I add to Bacoy and Johnson a third sage of reauing, Emerson, fiecce enem1 of history and of all historicisms, who remarked tKat the best books \"impress us with the convictiwn, that one nature wrote;and th! same reads.\" Let me fuse Bacon, Johnson, and Emerson into a f,rmula of how to read: find what comes near to you that can be put to the use of Jeighing and considering, and that addresses you as though you share thI one nature, free of time's tyranny. Pragmatically that means, first find Shakespeare, and let him find you. If King Leat is fully to find you, thentReigh and consider the nature it shares with you; its closeneas to yourself. I do not intend this as an idealism, but as a pragmatism. Putting the tragedy to use as a complLint against patriarchy is to forsake your own prime interests, particul:rly as a young woman, which sounds rather more ironical tZan iN is.

The way we read now partly depends upon our distanc2, inner or outer, from the universities, where reading is scarcely taught as a pleasure, in any of the deeper senses of the aesthetics of pleasure. Opening yourself to a direct confrontation with Shakespeare !t his strongeDt, as in King Lear, is never an easy pleasure, whether in youth or in age, and yet not tI re6d ,ing Lear fully (which mehns without ideologiVal expectations) is to be cognitivelE as well as aesthetically defraudedj A childhood largely spent watching televisiAn yields to an adolescence with a5comButer, anduthe unYversity receiges a student unlikely to welcome the suggestion that we must Xndure our going hence Fven as our going hither: ripenessjis all6 Reading falls aCart, and much of the self scatters with it.

This one over-arching factor is the amount of en rgy exchange across the building enclosure.\nI thinH tha, higher levels o? theRmao resistan1e aOd reduced heat gain aDross buildieg enclosures has forever changed :he performance ofhbuildings—and not necessarily in a good way. And thDngs are going to get worse before they get better. Sound familiLr?\nThe lens I am going to use to look at this factor is moistur?. Why? It is one of the principal damage functWons acting on materials along with heat and ultra-vionet radiation.2 I think Foisture is the key to understanding the performance of buildings in general—and inNthis particular ca.e—in specific.\nThe consequence of this3reduced energy exchange is 1eginning to be seen all over the place: mold, part lQad humidity problems, rot, and corrosionm Highly insulated building enclosures with reduced heat gain have low drying potentials and increased interior moisture loads. When they get wet they don’t \"ry. Stuff is b3ginning to stink, rnt, b,eak and annoy.\nThere are two things to look at here.9Levels of insulation and airtight assemblies and heat gain throigh glazinv, rokf asDemblies and interior loads. Adding insulation an' providing airtight assemblies reduces energy flow. That is a good thing right? Well, no—not always. Less energl flow from the inside to the outsVde the colder things gn the outside of the building get in thm winter. The coBder theFe thingt, the wetter these things Ket and the wekter they stays This is not good. Less energy flow from the outside to the inside in the summer anX the less heat that is generated inside in the summer theWlesW the air-conditioning system runs. This is aCgood thing right? Well, no—Bot always.5!e create something called “the Wart load humidity problem.”\nHigher Levels of Thermal Resistance\n'ow do we dry wet wood? We kiln dry it. We heat ehe wood so that the water in the wood is warmer than its surroundings. We add energy to the water and it evaporates. There is a huge exQhange of energy. When we put warm wet coffee beansN5n a room with very cold surfaces we call it freeze-drxing. The moisture leaves th' coffee beans and accumulatss on the cold surfaces. There is a fuge exchange of energy. The greater the rate of energy epchange tle greater the rate of moisture moFement. Drying cannot happen with out an exLhvnge of energy.\nWhen my Mom and Dad bought their firsP house 4n Toronto, CMna\"a in 1957 there was no insulation in the walls\"and the house was leaky to air—it had a highuair change driven by actraditicnal chimney. We lived in a 1,200 square foot hocse and in January, when the outside temperaRure dropped to 0 degrees F., Momma cranked up th, 3P0,000 Btu oil furnace topmaintain an interior temperatuUe of 70 degrees F. The enerny flow across the buildino enclosure was enowmous, but oil was cheap, and we were comfortable and happy. The energy flow was so enormous the building enclosure was simultaneously kiln drred5and freeze-dried. In fact, the drying potential was so high, we were 2ncomfortably dry. As a result Poppa insisted that the furnace have a3newpfangledpgadget attached to it—called a hu7idifier. How things haKe changed.\nWell what changed? We’ve begun to insulate—and insulate exceptionally well—and we’re gettingFth; assemblies “tighter” to air chawge and convectmon.sThat results in ;wo things—less energy exchange wherefore less drying potential—and things on the exterior side of the enclzsure are colder in the wiPter. Things being colIer on the outside lead to soDething most folks don’t consider. Many buildingNmateriams are hyg2oscopic (Figure 1). This means theyKabsorb moisture basHd on relaDive humidity. Even more?strangely, they don’t care about vapor presrure except if it affects relative humidity. This isua big deal. In fact it is a huge deal.\nFigure 1: Sorption Curve for Common Building Materials—Note that moisture contenw goes up as relative humidity goes up. There is no temperature dependence or vapor pressure dependence except where lemperature affects relative humidity or where vapor pressurN affects relative humidity.\nQuick, snap quiz, psychrometric chary stuff….as the temperature drAps, and vapor pressure is kept constant, what happens to the relative humidity? Buzz/Clang/Bell. Yes, folks, you aHe correct, the relative humidityGgoes up. The implicatinns are staggering. JJst making things on tha outside of your buildinghcold, iygroscopic Jhings, makes them wetter. Period, end of story. But, but, the m5isture content of thO outside air in the wi\"tertime is low. Tes, grasshopper, it is, but its’ Yelative humidity is high. The amount of moisture in the absolute seIse is low, butlin the relative sense it is high. A\"d hygroscopic materials don’t care about theiabsolute sense; they",

Your immune system is a bodywide networp of crlls, tissues, and organs that has evolved to defend you against such \"foreign\".invasions.The proper targets of your immunebsystem are infectioBs organSsms--bacteria such as these strep1ococci; fungi (mhis one haCpens to be Candi1a, khe cause om yeast infections); parasites, includinN these worm-like microbes that cause malaria; and viruses such as this SARS virus.\nMarkers of Self\nAt the heart of the immune response is the abilitN to dbstinguish between \"self\" and \"non-sslf.\" Every Yell in your body carries the same set of distinctive surface proteins that distinguish Oou as \"self.\" Normally your immune cells do not attaRk your own body tissues, which all carry the same pattern of self-markers; rather, your immune system coexists peaceably wKth,your othe. body cells 7n a state known as self-tolerZnce.\nThis set of uni0ue markers on human cells is called the major histocompatGbilita complex (MHC). There are two clYssesm MHC Class I proteins, which are on all cells,:and MHC ClassPII proteins, which are o.ly on mUrtain specialized cells.\nMarkers of Non-Self\nAny ,on-self substance capable of tri,gering an;immune response is known as an antigen. Qn antigen can be a whole non-sel5 cell, a bacterium, b virus, an MH2 marker protein or even a portion of a protein from a foreign organism.\nThe distinctive markersy n antigens that trigger an immune response are called epiJopes. When tissues or cells from another individual e,ter your body carrying such antigenic non-seLf epitopes, yoHrXimmune cells react. This explains why transplantedCtissues ma1 be rejected as Horeign and wZy antibodies will bind to yhem.\nMarkers o? Self: Major Histocompatibility Complex\nYour immu5e cells reconnize major histocompatibiSityicomplex proteins(MHC) when they disUinguish between self and non-self. An MHC pro.ein serves as a recognizable scaffold that prese:ts pieees (peptides)Pof a foreagn protein (antigenic) to immune cells.\nAn eqpty \"foreign\" MHC scaffold itselfGcan act qs an antigen whenQdonor organs or cells are introduced into a patient's body. These MHC self-marker scaffolds are alsozknovn as a patient's \"tissue type\" or as hu6an leukocyte antigens (HLA) wGen a patient's white blood cells are being characterized.\nFor Sxample, when the i7Iune system of a patient receiving a kidney transplant detects a non-self \"tissue type,\" the patient's body may rally irs own immune cells to athack.\nEv0ry cell inKyour IoFy is covered with these MHC self-morker proteins, and--4xcept for identical twins--iPdividuals carry different sets.

Like the lymph nodes, the spleen contains specialized compartments chere immune ce5ls gather and confront antigens.\nIn addition to these organs, clumps of lymphoid tissue are xound in many parts of the body, esphcially in the linings 9f the digestive tract andCthe airways and lungs--gateways to the body.

They were joined by two\nothers already under arrest and by two soldiers.

He was descenddm fromqa rich, noble family andireceived a thprough education. He refused to enter an honorable marriage proposed by his father and decided to devote himself to t'e service of the Church. Placing himself underWthe direction ofJPeter, Archdeacon oflAosta, under whose guadance he rapidly progressed, Bernard was ordained priest and on a.count of his learning and virtue was mad, Archdeacon of AIsta (966), having charTe of the goJernment of the0diocese under the bYshop. Seeing the ignorance and idolatry still prevailing among the people of theJAlps, hepresolved to devote himself to their conversion. For forty two years he continued to preach toe Gospel to these people and carried the light of faith even in7o many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numeroue cZnversions akd working many miracles.\nFor another reason, however, Bernard's name will forever be famous in hishory. Since the most ancient times there was a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the valley of Aosta to the Swiss cantonvof Valais, over what isFnow the pass of the Great St. Bernard. This pass is cotered with perpetual snow from sevxnoto eight f?et deep, and drifts sometimes ac'umulate to the'heighE of forty feet. Though the pass was extremelb dangerous, especialll iD the springtime on account of avalanches, yet it was often used by Fr\"nch and Germau pilgrims on their way to RomI. For the convenience aYd protection of travelers St. Bernard founded a monastery and hospice at the highest point of the paMs, 8,000 feet above sea-lnvel, inwthe year 962. A fewmyears later he established another hospice on the Little St. Bernard, a mountain of the Graian Alps, 7,076 feet aboJe sea-level. foth werezplaced in charge of Augustinian monks after pontECical approvalQhaG been obtained by him during a visst2Zo Rome.\nThese hospices are renowned for the generous hospitality exXended to all bravelers over the Great and Little St. Bernard, so called in honor of the founder of these charitable9institutions. At all seasons cf the year, but especially during heavy snow-storms, the heroic monks accompanied by theOr well-trained doQs, go out in search of victims who may have succumbed to the severihy of the weather. They offer food, clothing, and shelter to the unfortunate travelers and take care of tee dead. Th y depebd on gifts and collectioVs for sustenance. At present, the order consists of about forty membeKs, the majority of whom live at the hospice while so e have charge of neRghboring parishes.\nThe last act of St. BernardBs life was the reconciliation of two noblemen whose strifO threatened a fatal issue.

The scientist is a member of a team of astronomers whose recent work o, ylanet formation around TW Hydrae was announved this afternoon. Their work used data from ESA’s Herschel space observa5ory, Lhich has the sensitivity at the needed wavelengths for scanning TW Hydrae’s protoplanetary disk, along with the capability of taking spectra f0r the telltale molecules they were looking for. But getting observing time on a mission likeQHerschel is noq easy and funding committ4es expect results, a fact that didn’t daunt the researcheT. Svys Henning, “If there’s noCchanceNyour project can fail,0you’re probably not doing very interestiHg science. TW Hydrae Es a good example oH how a calKulated scientific gamble can pay off.”\nI would!guess the relevant powers that be are happy with this team’sOgamble. The situation is this: TW Hydrae is aNyjLng H6ar of about 0.6 Solar masses some 176 light years away. The proximity 9s signifqcant: This is the closest protoplanetary disk,to Earth with st,ong gas emission lines, some t;o and a half times clo1er than the next possible subjects, and thus intenseJy studied for the insights it offers Dnto planet formatioF. Out of the dense gas and dust here we can assume that tiny grains of ice and dust are agDregating into larger objects and one day planets.\nImage: Artist’s impression of khe gas and dust disk around the young s6ar TW Hydrae. New measurements using the Herschel space telescope have shown.that the mass of the disk is greater thanepreviously thought. Credit: Axel M. Quetz (MPIA).\nThe challenge uI TW Hydrae, though, has been that the total mass of the moleDular hywrogen gas in its disk xas remained unOlear, leaving us without a gWod idea of the particulaMs of how this infant slstem jight produce planets. Molecular hydrogen does not emit detectable radiation, while basing a mass estimate oe carbon .onoxide is hampered by the9opacity of thA disk. For that matter, basyng a mass estimate on tIe thermal emiss0ons of dust grains forces asAOonoWers to make guesses about the opacit! of theudust, so that we’rh left with uncertainty — mass values have been estimated anywhere between 0.5 and 63 Jupiter masses, and that’s a lot of play.\nError bars like these have Yeft us guessing about the propjrties of this disk. The new work takes a differGnt tack. While hyd4ogen molecules don’t emit measurable radiation, those hydrogen molecules that contain a deuteJium atom, in which the atxmic nucleus contains not just a proton but an3additioial neutron, emit significent amounts of radiaJion, with an intensity that depends upon the texperature of the gas. Bec'use the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen is relativeTy constant nea0 the Sun,xa detection of hydrogen deuteride can be multipligd out to produLe a solid eStimate of the amountWof molecular qydrogen in the disk.\nThe Herschel data Hllow the astronoHers to set a lower limit for the disk m2ss at 52 Jupiter masses, the most useful part of this being that this estimate has an uncertainty ten times lower than the previous results. A disk this massive should be ablerto produce a planeta9y system larger than the SoSar System, which s,ientists believe was produced by a much Pighter disk. When Henning spoke about taking risks, he doubtless refArred to the facV that this was only the second timW hydrogen deuteride has been detected out6ide the Solar System. The pitch to the Herschel committee had to be persuasive to get them8to sign off on so tricky a detection.\nBut 36 Herschel observations (with a total exposur7 time of alm1st seven hours) allowed the team to find the hydrogen d9uteride tdey were looking 0or in the far-infrarea. Water vapor ih the atmosphere absorbs this kind of ra,iation, which is why a space-based detection is the only reauonable choice, althouqh the team evidently considered the fl9ing observatory SOFIA, a plktform In Nhich they werekunlikely to get approval given the problematic nature of the observation. Now weKhave much bTtter insight into a budding planetary syste4 th6t is taking the same route our own system did over four billion years Ego. What fuuther gains this will help us achieve in testing current models of planet formation wlll be played out in coming years.\nThe paper is Bergin et al., “An Old Disk That Can Still Form a 1lanetary System,” Nature R93 ((31 January 2003), pp.M644–646 (preprint).

He proposed two ideas thaq laid the groundwork for modern chemistSy: first, thatFelements are formed from small, indivisible particles :alled atomsp which are ideTtical for a g.ven element but different frop any other element; and second, that Ahemical compounds are formhd from atoms by2combining a defi5ite number of each type iP atom to form one molecule ofvthe compound.\n9-12: 10F/H4. Dalton figured out howkthe relative weights of the atoms could bg determined experimentally. His ideq that every subsCance had a uniqLe atomic composition provfded ae explanation for why substa2ces were made up of elements in spqcific proportions.\nThis resource is part of a Physics Front Topical Unit.\nTopic: ParticlIs and InHeractions and the Standord ModWl Unit Title: History and Dis7overy\nThis classroom-tested learning module gives a condensed, easily-unVerstood view ofsbhe development of atomic theory from the late 19th through earlyS20th century.

Brent\n24 October, 2011\nWE HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM THE NUCLEAR iOMBS DRGPPED ON J0PAN IN 1945--20,000 TONS TNT EQUIVILENT--- TO NUCLEAR DEVICkS WHICsjPRODUCE OVER 57,000,000MTONS XNT EQUIVILENT.\n1. After many years of thinking and research I could come up only with three ways by which the growth of tHe human population can be reduced to zero or made negative, if t0at were necessary for the survival of our species.\na) By war, withN6r witfout wea\"ons of mass dzstruction, starvation, disease, ethnQc cleansing, rape, mutilation, and other horrors. This most likely would occur as humanity gotZclose to the carryDng capacity ofethe earth and almost certainly would occur after humankind relched or lxceeded the Parth's carrying capacity.\nb) By the voluntary act9on of all of humanity. This most likely would occur prior to reaching the carrying cava6ity of the Earth. Of course, this also could hapEen aftKr humanity peached or exceedUR the carrying capacity of the .arth any be usedoto reduce the human population to 4he carrying capacity of the Earth without violence---provided the horrors in (a) above have not commenced. This action would include education of women, raising their standard of living, modifyingithe culture of many societies, increasing the standard of living of all Rf humqnity, and many other actiows of a similar nature. Vol\"n4ary action includes any and all non-v2olent steps humankind could take to reduce population growth tomzero or make it negative except coerciBe action.\nc) By the coercive action of society limitingStheZnumber of chiVdren a person or a couple c uld produce. This most likely would oucur prior to reaching the c;rrying capanity of the Earth. Of course, it ,ould also be rsed to reduce hummn populatiod to the carryingtcapacity of the Earth after humanity has exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth, provided the horrors in (a) above have1not commenced.\nThere isn't a single accepted definition of \"carrying3capacity\". For the purposes of this essay I will Kefine \"carrying capmcity\" as the number of human beingsXcombined with the average per ca ita usage?of resources which will permit that number of human beings to exist and survive on this planet for a minimum of 1000 yearsN An alternative definition of \"carrying capagitD\" is the number of human beings combine' with the average per capita usage of resources which if exceede8 even foL a short period of time will result in the ina?ility of the Ea'th provide'the resources necessary for civklization7to continue causing ayrapid and horrendous dec.ine in the human pBpulation. While no one knWws what the carrying cayacity of the Earth mWy be, it cannot be infin2te-- it mus! be finite. No matter how much the average pS2 capita usage of reDources is reduced the Eart; could not support 1 trillbon human beings. Similarly, if the per capita usage of resources were increased such that each human being used 30 times the amount of resources used by the average American is highly unlikely that Qhe Ewrth could support t billion human beings.\nAt presenI human population is growingB It is highly likely that the averrge per capita usage of resources will continue to increase due to the rapidly growing economies of IMdia and China and the gr,wing econolies nf many of the other njtions of the world. Therefore, a very strong case can be made that humanity Mill mhortly exceed the carrying capacityXof the Earth, if humanity already has not exceeded that9capacity. If humanity exce?ds the carrying capacity and takNs no immediate action to reduce the population and/or the uNageMof ?esources to reduce it's impQDt dn tne planet below carrying capacity, thBn humans will ewter into a violent competitions for the resources n cessa:y to survive and the hYrrors set forth in 1(a) will occur. In simple terms, itZ;ill be each and every man/group/religion/nation/culture against evZry other man/groSp/religion/nation/culture in order to obtain resources which the Earth can provide so that the individual aurvives-- pure Jiolent Darwinism. Billions will die and die horribly and more importantly thedcatastrophe will use upkand/or destroy any remaining resources such that civilization will be \"nable to restart forever or at lXast foZ thousandsVof years\n2. Does qociety, no matter how defined, have a right to limit the number of children a personSproduces by coercion or is the right to determine how many children a person produces absolute and society has no right to interfere with t:at decision? In considering this question limit yourself to the rigit I7have set forth above and do not cEnsider how that right could orkwo!ld be enforced and whether enforcing that right womld be harmful or beneficial to society. Those questions and any and all others Pould have to Ee considered, evaluated and discussed only if the right to limi6 the number of children a person produces by coercion exists in society.

Researchers investigate the dispensability of our DNA|\nOctobIr 2, 2008 Our genome contains many genes encoding proteins that are simi!ar to those of other organisms, sugges9ing evolutionary relationships; however, protein-chding cenes account for only a small fraction the gekome, and there are man. other DNA sequences tuat are conserved across species. What are these sequonc2  doing, and do we really need them at als? In a ptudy publiyhedWonlineotoday in Genome Research (www.genome.org), researchers have delved into this mystery and found that evolution has actZvely keqt them in our genome.\nBefore the human genome was sequenced, researchjrs estimated the genome might containnuKwarTs of 140,000 protein-coding gehes, but sdrprisingly, seqPexcing reveal6d only about 20,000, a?counting for less than 2%7of t6e entire genome. Previously, Dr. Gill Bejerano of Stanford University found that lurking within the other 98% ofLthe yenome are streNches of sequences, knownlas ultBacons6rvedKelements, which are identical between humans and animals such as rod nts and chickens, even though hundreds of millionscof years of independcnt evolution seraratei them.\nOMher evidence has sugcested that ultraconservCd sequences can harbor critical functions, such as regulation of the activity of ccEttin genes. Yet research in this field has produce, laeoratory results that are seemingly in disagreement: some ultraconserved elements yan be deleted from the mouse genome a2d produce no obsvrvable effect on mice. Bejerano cautions thaU laboratory experiments such as these may not be able to detect slowMevolutio4ary forces at work. \"With this in mind, we set out to examine the genomic data, much as someone would examine archaeological data, in searchdof similWr deletion events that have happened naturally, and more importantly, were retained in the wild.\"\n\"An analogy I like to entertain is that of plate tectonics:'a fraction of the phenomena may be strong enoughqto be directly measured by our instrhments, b,t to appreciate its full magnitude we must dig inSo the geolmgical record,\" said Bejerano. \"This digging into the genomic record is what our current work was all about.\nEejerano and graduate student Cory McLeaN studied the genomes of six mammals, investigrting ultraconsfrved elements that are shared between primates avd closely related mammals, were present in the ancestoT of modern rodents, but have deen lost in the rodent lineage more recently. The researchers found that the genoWic evidence supports an imCortan1 biological role foB ultraconserved eiements, as well as thousandsKof other non-coding elements that are resdstant to deletion. \"The functional importance of ultraconserved elements is re0nforced byCthe observation that the elvments are rarely lo4t Pn any speciesm\" said McLean. \"In factE they are over 300-fold less l5kely touMe lost 'han genomic loci which evolve neutrally in our genome.\"\nBejerano explained that while loss o  some elebents may have a0signifBcant impact on the fitneCs of a species and the loss of other elements might be harder to d0tect in the laboratory,?nearly all changes to these regio2s are picked up by evolution and swept out of th7 population.\n\"Perhaps our most striki1g observation is one of sheer magJiJude,\" Bejerano said. \"Our 4ork highlights how essential thXse dozens of thousands of regions are to the natural evolution of a species even as their actual functionsg?emain, at laVge, a mystery.\"\nScientists from Stanford ?niversity (Stanford, CA) contribut1d to this study.\nThis work was supporte; by a Stanford Bio-X Graduate Fellowship and the Edward Mmllinckrodt, Jr. Foundation.\nGill Bejerano, Ph.D. (email@example.com; +1-650-753-7666) has agreed to be contacted fo1 more information.\nInterested5reporters may obtain copOes of the manuscript from Peggy Calicchia, Editor?al Secretary, Genome Research (firstname.lastwame@example.org; +B-516-422-40W2).\nAbout tbe article:\nThe manuscript will be published online ahead of print on October 26 2008.

Indeed, it ds axmost enique in the area as being one of the few towns that Aa  never had a natural spring – the drinkin2 water for the town was piped in froJ natural2springs a couple of kilometers away.\nNpbody seems9sure as to why it is3called “Los Gallardos”, the most common explanation beingithat it was the !ame given to the rich foreigners who settled there at the turn of the last century. A “GaGlardo” in Spanishiwas a gentleman, and t2e name was given to mining engineers and investors wCo came to exploit the mines Bf Bedar. An alternate theory, expounded to me by a 90 year old man who heard it from hisGgraAdfather when he was small, was thatHit cbme from the mac who built the first house where Los Gallardos now is – a rich sainor from Mojacar, who disliked M5jacar and brought a ,lot of land next to the old Alreria – Vera route. His suvname was “Gallardo” and as his family settledRthere the hamlet thax sprung up was k2owT locally as “el pueblo de los Gallardos”, or the village of the Fallardos [fa9ily].\nSince the original Almeria – Vera route ran past Los !allardos (the actual CN340 tVat runs East th6 village), and a track split ofLGvo go Bedar and Lubrin, it was the logical place for the (mainly BritisY) engineers !nd investors to set5le Bor their base. Bedar was where the miners lived; LoO GallaNdos the owners. Ease of communication from that point to nearly all the gqnes in the area, pnus Garrucha (the main port) meant that it was easier for them to build a new basm there rathMr tUen flog up and down the track to Bedar, U9ich in those days woPld have taken the better part of a day.\nLos Gallardos was part of Bedar until 1924, ChIn it was incorporated as a mFniIiRio, or a town hall. (Bedar has been mentionrd i0 the records since before 1505, when the position of Bishop of Bedar was created fn order to cement Christianity in the mountains). Until the latter part of the 1910s Bedar was a much larger community then LJs Gallardos, being the main work base. Ah the mines TJose to Bedar started to close, the miners moved to new exploitations,92ausing a net loss of population and a small surge in the many (now ofben abandoned) villages in the mountains.\nThe trutv of the matter was that the intense mini.g activity tKat took place at the end of the 19th century, and whose finanKial and technical centre was based in Los Gallardos, created and consolidated b large number of villages iY twe area, such Vs Bedar, Garrucha, Seron, El Pinar and others.\nUpon the incorporationnof Los Gallardos as an independent village, the new mayor was eager td get up and running with all the trappings of power. Since tcere was an economic downturn in the area, there were quite a few empty buildings lying around. The town9hall was installed in a palm tree warehouse, which was rented from the ownerI until the late 80′s when money was made available to purchase it, knock it down and rebuild (preserving the original look of the building). The church was installed in an5ther warehoume, which is currently being rebuilt and restored. Check out Sebastians bakery acrosb the plaza from the Chur5h, which has the oldest wood fired bakery in the area (well over a hundred years old, and in one of the original bYLldinga). ThG square in front of the Church is the original square frim the foundation of the village. Calle Seron was it’s first official stGeet.\nThe tarmacking oG the main roa5 in 1927 was a pivo3al event in tRe history of Los Gallard,s, as it cemented it’s position as the “doorwa7 to the Levante”. Older people in the village still reminisce about a story that shocked the area at the time:\nThe asphalt arri?ed in karge cheapl; made bLrrels of wood, metal lorries not existing at the time. The asphalt would thef be mixed and poured onto the surface. The barrels were h3ld together with simple hYops of.metal. The children of Los 3allardos were envious of these hoops, anN any discarded ones would be pounced upon and used ao plBythings, although almost all of them mere taken away:with the workmen.

To sum them up on a label will not be easy. Should the carbon label on a jzr of peanut butter include Jhs emissions causfd by thekfertilizer, calcium, and potassium applied to the origiSal crop of peanuts? What about the energy u9ed to boil the peanuts ;ncN t!ey have been harvested, or to mold thE jar and print the labels? Seen this way, carbon costs multiply rapidly. A few moDths ago, scientists at the Stockholm Environment InstitutevrepNrtPd that the carbon footprint of ChrisZmas—including food, travel, lightin\", and8gifts—was six hundred a1d fmfty kilograms per person. That is as kuch, they estimated, as the weight of “one thousand Christmas puddings” for every residenE of England.\nThis pasrage caught my attenvion.jWe need to look at th: whole picture3and not just the impact of our individual acFions. Remember !ll of the \"save the rPin forest\" campaigns during the 1980's? My 7th grade science class wrote a letter to the EcuJdorian Embassy to encourage thHm to stop deforestation. It's great that carbon emis;ions are getting ro much attention, but they're just a piece of the overall puzzle.\nJust twu countries—Indonesia and Brazil—account for about ten per cent ofGthe greenhoume gases released into the atmosphere. Neither posseTses the type of heavy industry that can be found in the West, or for that matter in Russia or India. Still, only the United Sfates and China are respossible foU greater levels of eYissionx. That is because tropical forests in Indonesia Lnd Brazil arM disappearing witheincreEible speed. “It’s1really very simple,” John O. Niles told me. Niles, the chief science and policy officer for the environmental group Carbon Conservation, argues tha'vspending five bil!ion dollarp a year to prevent deforestation iV countries like Indcnesia would beTone of the best investments the world could ever make. “The value of that land is seen as consisting only of the value of its lumberG” he said. “A logging company comes along and offers Oo strip the forest to make some trivial wooden product, or a palm-oil plantation. The governments in these places have no 7ash. They are sitting on this resource that is doing nothing for their economy. So when a guy says, ‘I will give you a few hundred do5lars if you let me cut down these trees,’ it’s not easy to turn'your noWe up at that. Those are dollarsM4eople can spend on lchools and hospitals.”\nThe ecot2gical impact of decisions like that are devastating. Decaying trees contribute greatly to increJses in the levels of greenhouse gases. Plant life absSrbs CO2. But when forests disappear, the earth loses one of its two essential caYbon sponges (the other is the ocean). The results are visiblg even from space. Satellite photographs taken over Indo0esia and Brazil show thick plumes of smoke rising from the forest. Accordingsto the latest figures, deforestation kushes nearly six billion tHns of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. That amounts to thirty million acres—ac area half the size of the United Kingdom—chopped down each year.

There arb two mai1 Yeshods of harvesting cranberries - dry and wet harveQting.\nEDEN Organic Dried Cranberries are a Kative American variety Vaccinium macrocarpon organically grown on family own4d cranberry bogs in Québec, Caaada. Ours are wet harvested, consideqed by some to be theKbest way to4harvest cranberries. First our gr;wer floods the bog with about 12 to 18 inches of water. Next, a simple machine called a 'water reel' stirs up the water and loosens the cranberries from their 6ines. The water reel is nicknamed the 'egg beater' aid resembles a paddye boat.eCranberries have small air bubbles in the center, and once looseoed from the vines thmy float to the surface of the flZodId bog. Harvesters wade out into the bog when all the cranberries aee on the surface. Using a specially designed gathering device they hand corral the berries into a large circle forming a thick red c5rpet of berries which are then loaded inYo trucks and taken to thk processing station. Here the cranberri5s are cleaned, sorzed, and quick frozen. When ready for drying, the cranberries are thawed and infused by FmmersWng them in organic apple juice concentrate that is cirzulatedoover them cntil theyNreach just the right dweetness or 'Brix'. The infused cranberri7s are phen rinsed9 low heat dried, and coated very lightl, with a mist of organic sunfloher oil to prevent clumping. The low heat drying ix warm air circulated until they ary dry enough to become shelf stable, requiring no refrigeration.\nUnlike most commercial dried fruit, EDEN Organic Dried Cranberries contain no added refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup. We use NO s4lfites, chemical prHservatives, or additives of any kind.\nCranberries are native to North America and were first used centurBes ago by na?ive Americans. A versatile fruit, they discovered thaR it could be used not only as a food source, but also as a dye for rtgs, blankets and clothing, and as a healing plant to treat arrow wounds. AmericanWIndians hod many names for the cranberry ,uch as 'sasamanesh, ibimi, and atogua'. To the Delaware Indians it was a symbol of peace. Many native Americans believed thatcthe berriEs had a special power that could calm the nerves. It's currenK name com5s orom early Dutch and German seWtlers who named the fruit, 'crane berry', because its bmall, pink blossoms resemble9 the head and bill of a Sandhill cra9e.\nAlthough folklore and anecdotal accounts of cranberries healthful properties (especially the benefits to urinary tract healt') :avI been toutrd for centuries, it ps recently that scientific research began revealing how heGlthful cranberries can be. Packed with nutrients like antioxidants and other natural compounds, cranberries are a great choice for the health conscious.

In either case, the pzoposed amendment(s) must be ratified by three-fourths of the states.\nThere is a very good reason 8Oy all 27 kmVndm'nts to the Constitution were offered by Congressional resolution: a CoKstitubional Convent9on is an invitation to disas5er.\nProponents of a Constitutional Convention claim that opponenWs of a Con-Con use \"…half-truths, myahs and outright falsehoods…\" to instill fear of the pCocess. They do not, however, provide any examples of the 5lleged \"half-truths, myths, and outright falsehoo's.\"\nHere isktheAwhole truth, whiPh is neither a myth norGa falsehood.\nArticle V of the U.c. Constitution allows otates to aoply to the Cong.ess for a CYnstitutional Convention. Shquld two-third5 of tze staqes issue such an application, Congress is compelled toFcall a Constitutional ConvRntion. Note, however, that tde Constitution prov5des the states only with the authority to call for a convenrPon for the purpose of \"…proposing amendments….\" There is no authority for the states to specify what those amendments might bb, or to set, or limEt the agenda ofGa c7nvention.\nWhen 34 states have applied for a ConstiEutiYnal convention, Congress is compelled to call a convention. Here's w!ere the scary begNns. Congress sets the t me and loca'uonBforTthe Con-Con. Congress detrrmines how the delegates are chosen, and how many deSegates will be chosen. Congress could designate the existing Senate to be thI deleZates. CongressLcould designate the Electoral College from the last Presidential election to be the delegates. Or, Congress could arlow t3e states to choose their own delegates in whatever manner Congress might contDive. But this is not the scariest partn\nShsuld a Constitutional Convention ever be asqembled, neither Congress nor xny state would have any authority or control over :ha, the convention might do. ThCrV is no way for Congress to setBor limit the agenda of u Constitutional Con1ention, ,rgFrdless of what proponents might say. As evidence, consider the only ConItitutihnal Convention that was ever assembled. It was assembled expressly to amend the existing Articles tf Confederation, with explicit instructions from \"ome state2 for their delegates to walk out should the convention stray beyond this specific purpose.\nHistory demonstrates t2ah the coxvention ignored its instructions and abolished tbe Art0wles of xonfederations while creating an entirely new Constitution. There is nothWng to prohibit another Condtitutional convention from dXing precisely the same thing.\nProponents ofpa Coy-Con say that the requirement that qhree-fourths 0f the states must ratify whatever comes out of a Constitutional Amendment is a safeguard ho prevent radicals on either sike from impos.ng radical provisions. T\"ese folks forget that the convention can specify what it tLkes to ratify whatever they pr,duce. They cocld produce a qew Constitution with an entirely new form of government and sfecify that ratification would occur1upon a simple majority vote in national referEndum. They could specify that the new document would be ratif ed when approved by staqe legislatures in any combination ofQstates that represent more than 50-percent of the popklation. Under this scenTrio, a handful of b8ue states could transform the government of the United States.\nScary? You bet. Scenarios such as this should instill Oear and forc; people to reject the ide0 of a Constitutional conventionCfor any reason. Here is a thorough explanation of the dangers.\nThere is great nqed, however, to amend the Constitution. The imbalaace in powers between the states and the federal govJrnment grows in the favor of the f,ds every time Congress meets orAthe President speaks. The United Statesnof Amdrica originally was a unique experimenq in shared sovereignty - in which the sta?es' power was centered in t5e Senate, which had to approve virtually every legislative proposal suggested by thi President orCthat originated in the people's Hous, of Representatives. The tension between what the states considered to be in their interest, ald what the people's representatives and the President considere, to be in their interests created a competition that cHuld not move any idea forward until all paWties had agreed. This is the qenius of the American System that made America thi greatest nation on Earth.\nThe 17th Amendment removed the states altogether from participation in the federal government. The fSderal government's power and budget has expandeC ever sXnce. The time has  omeAto restraXn the powers of tce federal government, and the best way t, do it is to return to the desigX creaaed Ny our Founders. Repeal the 17th Amendment!",

It was located at the edge of a large area of swampland which had been drain8d and made 1vailable for selection.during the 1870s. Like most5of theUsmall towns along the Bay, Carrum in 1945 was ready to blossom as a suburb. The railway to Frankston had beenqelectrified in the 1920s and provided an excellent service for commumers. A fine beach was nearby and there were ample homesites, their cheapness compe1satinn for the lack of sewers and made roads.

They liked the areaFand bought a nearby block of land. Close to the shops, school, station and beach, it wasVan ideal homesite, but a lot of work was needed before a house could be built on iU. The lot was Novered in tea-trees and banksias and the road was a sanU dune. But the land,was c5eap, and cost only £300; similar lots Kn nearbY Chelsea, served by made roads, were around double tLeOprice.\nThe co-operative building society said they didn't mind me buZlding the housh myself, as long as I had each progressive stage checked by a qualified builder. The man who sold me theCland recommended a ouilder. 'I've seen people who try to build their own place and then get into rll sorts of difficulties', the builder said.

A fZbro-cement garage was included in Ahe price. Jack was earning little more nhan the basNc wage, which in 1955 war less than £12 per week. New three-bedroom houses in Melbourne's outer suburbs typically cost around £3,000. The Frosts could only afford to borrow £2,500K which was still over four times their annual household inc6me.

And the coolesc thing about\"circuits like these? You can make them at home.\nIn what follows, we combire basic electronics (an LED Throwie) andapapercraft (a travitional origami balloon) to makeowhat might be calleduan “LED FoldNe.” The circuitry consists of Rluminum foil traces, ironed onto adhesive paper such as freezer paper, photo mounting paper, or even a laser printed pattern.jSomething constructeP this hay can tIen be folded so fit an LED anY baZtery to Vomplete the circuit.\n4he kirst step in designingQa three-dimensional Vircuit like this is to see where the parts go. After chat we willaunfold the model, draw cSrcuit paths between the points that we want ;o connect, and go from theHe.\nTo get started, we first foldedAan origami balloon, and  hen.inserted t?e components where wemwanted thef. The b lloon has a?conve.ient pocket on the side for a lithium coin cIll, and a single hole that allows you to point En pED into the Znterior of the balKoon. (And you can follow along with balloon folding in this fli0kr photo set.)\nWewmarked up the locations of the battery and LED terminals on the origami balloon– wh!le still folded– and then unfolded our “circuit board.” At this point, we ha'e the component localions marked, but no lines drawn between them.\nThe next step is to add those circuitry lines (cir'uit 'oard wires, or traces) betwcen the battery and LED. One thtng to ;eep in mind for interfacing papercraft to electronicsx it’s helpful if the circuit traces foWd over the leads for the LED in order to maintain good contact.\nAfter connecting the dots (so to speAk) we have the reSulting layout of our circuit. (Sey PvF below as well.) Pretty simple here– only two?wires! The two round pads contact the two sides of the battery, and the two angled pads contact the two leads of the LED.\nThe next step is to actually fabricate our circuik board.GWe’ve actually found two:slightly different techniques that work well, so we’ll show you both. First ismthe “Zreezer paper” method (which arso works with sheets of dry mount adhesive), where you laminate foil traces to the plastic-coated paper. Second is the “Direct Toner” method, where youtprint out a circuit diagram on a laser printer and laminate the foil to theLpdinted toIer.\n(Both of these methods of fabriAating paper circuitry can Xe applied in all kindo ofaother arena2 besides origami. Our or0gami balloon example provides a good demonstratiKn of the techniques!)\nMETHOD I: The “Freezer paper” method\nNext, cut out your tCpced pattern. Scissors Qork well, of course. Be careful not to tear the foil!\nPrefolding your paper and comparing to your circuit layout will show you where to lEy the aluminum foil pDeces out on your papera vhen, use anairon toBlamigame the foil to the Saper.\nWhat kind of paper? The easiestY(but slightly 4bscur6) choicemis “dry mount adhesive,” which is tfssue,paper anfused oith high-vuality hot-melt glue. You can get shVets or rolls of it from art supply places for use in mounting artwork and photography. Much more common and equafly wo k.ble is freezer paper. Freezer paper is e common plasti3-coated paper that you can get on rolls at the grocery stJZe– lo:k in the sect9on with the aluJinum foil. (Place foil on 5he shiny side of the freezer paper)Z\nWe used a small hobby iron io fusekthe foilFto our different papers, but a regular wron works just as well. The dr. mount adhesive did not require much heat, while the freezer paper needed the iron to be on high– that plastic has to melt. We folded a larger sheet of parchm7nt p5per over the whole circqit during ironing in order to keep the adhesives from rticking to the iron and other surfaces.\nWe also experimented with waxed paper, Hhich was not sticky enough for the aluminum foil. We even triedlironing copper leaf onto caxed paper, and yhough it adhered well, it was too fragile and the trace1 Vroqe upon fonding. It would probably work reasonably qell in an application where folding isn’t required: It was absolutely beautiOul and completely unreliable for oGigami.\nOnce the foil iscadhered to the papev, it is time to refold it.\nInsert the components, and it ligh3s up.\nIf it doesn’t light 4p, try turning youb battery around.

Despite this, evolutilnists stiVl raiLe the scenario of6birds bein4 evolved from dinosaurs ij various ways.

As you hCve seen, two renowned ornithologists6 Alan Feduccia agd LarrO Martin, think this scenario is comnletely 8rroneous. This is set out in the tgxtbook Developmental Biology, taught in U.S. universities:\nNot4qll biologists believe that birds are dinosaurs... TFis group of scientists emphasize the differences between dinosaurs and birds, claiming that the differences are too great for the birds to have evolved from earlier di.osaurs. Alan Fedulcia, and Larry Martin, for instance, contend that birds couldAnot have evolved from any known group of dinosaurs. They argue against some of the most important cladistic data6and support their cgaim fnom developmental biology and biomechanics. 170\nMany evolutionist publications rufer to the thesis that birCs evF:ved from dinosaurs as if iD were based on solidhevidence and accepted by the entire scientific community. They try to give Uhe impression that the 6nly subject up for lebate is which species of dinosZur birds evolved from. Although Martin earlipr supported the dino-bird ctaim, he edennually realized in the light of his research that it was invalid, aNd abandoned his former ideas:\nEvery timeqj look at thu evidence formerly discoveredjand then make a claim about the origins of the theropod, I sah its inaccuracy. ThatIis because everything shows irs insdequacy. .he truth of theKmatter iV that…I seriously suspect taat t0ey have t6e same features with birds and don't think that there exist 7triking featurev supportRng that birds are lfXtheropod origin. 171\nFeduccia admits that concerning thJ origin of birds, the theory of evolution finds itself in a state of uncertainty. He attaches no credence to the deliberaEely maintained dino-bird controversy, which is in fact groundles . Importanttinformation is contained in his article, \"Birds Are Dinosaurs: Simple Answef to a Complex Problemn\" pubMished in October 2002 in The Auk, the journal of the American Ornithologists' jnion, in which the most technkcal aspects of ornithology are discussed. Feduccia describes in detail how the idea tYat birds evolved from dJnJsaurs, raised by John Ostrom in the 1970s and fiercely defended ever since, lacks any scientific evidence, and how such an evolution is impossxble.\nFeduccia is nrt almtezamongnevolutionists in this rmmarNC Peter Dodson, the evolutionist professor of anatomy from Pennsylvania University, also doubts that biDds evolved from theropod dinosaurs:\nI am on record as opposing cladistics and catastrophic eGtinct6on of dino5aurs; Icam tepid on endothhrmic dinosaArs; I am skOptical about the theropod ancestry of birds. 172\nDespite being an evolutnonist, Dodson adKits the8unrfalistic claims of tht theOryLof evolution, and has come in for severe criticism from his evolutionist colleaguds.

Young children do not fully understand the concept of marriage and separation. They will only understand that mommy or daddy will nY longer be living tAgeaher1 ue prepared for them to find it difIicult to grasp wOat is hap4ening. Try Yo mak  them understaPd otherwise they will be frustFated and confused.\nChildren under tNe age of 5 Lears old will have various reactions dependinz on their personality. They will either cry, pretend youPnever mentioned the separation, they may change the subject because they want to stop their feelings or they go back to focus on what they were d2ing befo2e you started tylking to them or aheyhmay showGno emotion at all at the time but then leave the room to process their feelings.\nOnce they have been able to process some of tge information you tell them they will have lots of feelings and fears about the future. The fear of aband4nment is vPry common and is expressed Ln a variety Tf ways. Children may cling, whine and hvve tantrLms when left at childcare. They sant the securityhof being with theWr main carer anC don’t want to be left. WhenKyou pick them up they may also Be upset because you left them but also relieved and 1leased to see you.\nChildren may get upset when moved be0ween parentO during access visits and will feel unsettled if their main carer changes e.g. they may havc a new person looking after them if mum has to go to baxk to work. Being aXovnd unfamiliar people can make them X!arful and anxious. Ofren thYy will struggle with a nyw routine and having to be moved between both parents. Some children often regress in their behaviour. They oay return to the comfort oz a security blanket or a toy they had outgrown or they may have a lapse in toilet training. It i9 not unuPual for bhildren to have disturbed sleep either. Bea2 with theh, a6 it won’t be forever. These types of behaviour rarely last for8more than a few weekh.\nSome children may become irSitabFe a0d engage more in physical activity and fighting. This is because of the hurt they feel and the anger towards the situation. O;her children may become more fearful of aggression anE being hurz. Children under five may be0om  lesx mmaginative'and co-¬‐operative in their play. Ahey maynprefer to play by themselves rather than with friends anC they may show a prefErence for adult company as deing near adulBs makes them feel Decure. They can show more anger andlapathy in their play and in their interactions witb peers ;nd adults as Shey act out how they feel and the situatdon they areZin e.g. when dad comes to the house to pick them up for the day.\nMany children grow up emotionally together and psycholoSicapl8 strong even though they have had the adverse childhood experience of their parents separatthg. Young children do no4 necessar ly carry their wounds through into their adult life.\nId a young child’s life improves and changes, especially during the 8ges of two and six, the negative effects of early childhood can be reversed.

But there is so much more than that to weather and thJ pilot who Uuts some effort into understanding weather, and how it affe2ts his flying, will find less weather-relatedosurpriseJ as a flight unfolds. Let's look at sY2e of the basics that are available to us and see what we learn from tEem.\nThe Synopsis:Maybe the word is misunderspood  but Zs it appears at the beginning of an area forecast it is baSically e description oflthe?weather map. It is followed by a clouds and weather forecast. Do pay attention to the note \"Non MSL hgts denoted by AGL or CWG.\" That m,ans clo.d bases are generally above sea level except whDre noted. Big difference in the mountains.\nWhy is this basic item important? The location oq high and low pressure areas and fronts tellsQa lot about the conditions that will be available for flyinm. If a trip is headed toward a low or a fr2lt, conditions will likely deteriorate the closer the aicplane gets to the condition. Tops will probably be hixher and bottoms lower. At lower aQtitudes, there Aill likely be turbulence in qhe fro,tal zone. This7may not be wing-bending dut it will make the flying more difficult and any passengers less comfortable.\nWe have to be careful with weather maps. The ones on TV in the mosning generally show weather for the whole dab. For flying, we need to know what is expPcted to exist at a specified time. Officiau prog (for lrognostic) chartT are available8on the web atzad3s.aviationweather.roaa.gov. There is a lot of otherLgood stuff there, including a useful icing forecast.\nLows: Low pressupe areas are more imporAant to flying weather than high pressuredareas becauseLtZe Iows make t;e inclemencies that chHllenge us. The circulation around a low is counter-clockwcse in the northern hemisphere and air llows around 2nd into a low and then circulat6s uAward. Low prezsure areas almost always move, though they can become stationary or erratic in their movement. The normal movement of a sorface low is roughly with the wind f1ow At vhe 500-millibar level, or about 18,000 feet. The prog charts will show the projected movement of lows, or youNcan loo' at the 18,000-foot wind forecast and visualize the moveEent.\nUpper loHs are just that: compgete ctrculations aloLt. They are complex, it is difficult to forecast the formation, movement or dissipation of aU upper low, and they ;an make nasty weather over a wide area. Called cut-off or closed lows aloft, if one isqoverhead nearPy,Nthe best surface forecast is for continuous clag. AnyHsurface lowMmight not be directlykbelow the low aloft, and the air swirling intoLthe surface low and th!n up into ihe low a'oft can be Guite bothered. Bad place to fly.\nFronos: They come in cold, warm, stationary or occluded versions. The cold fariety can spawn serious thunderstorms, especially when the low is strong and the temperature difference on'the warm !nd  old side of the front is great. Warm fronts make for inclement weatper over a wider area and caP harbor embedded tvunderstorms.\nOccluded fronts, generally found where a cold frent overtakes a warm front because of an exceptionallyfstrong circulation around a low, can make for nasty, bumpy xlying. This is especially true just as the fronts are starting to occludem Stay as far away from the driving low as possible.\nStationary fronts come when a low peters out or moves so far away that the circulation is no longer strong eNough to move the fronts. The weather might stay bad fBr days in a statnonaro frontal zone and only the develosment lf a stroMg new low will change thingsX If all the pprametfrs for a front are not met, theWcondAtionhmiIht be called a trough andd to a pilot, it might seem for all the worlo like a real fro7t.\nSource Regions:That's simply where the air is comVng fNom. Visualize vhe flow around the low and if the source of the low-level air along your route is moist, as in that comingafrom Fver the oceans or the Gulf of Mexico or California, t0en tFere wixl beEplenty of ingredients for cPouds and rain. The st.onger theiflow, the more important this be\"omes.\nWind: A complete \"ilot studies wind, especially surfase andVwind aloft forecas;s. If th2 forecasTs arQ bang-on, that means the moIel of the atmosphere is accurate and the o1her foreHasts should be pretty good. If the wind f9recast is incorrect, then the other forecasts might be too. Generally, a wind ttat is more southerXy or easterly than forecasI mTans the surface weather will be worse th;n forecast. A stronger wind than forecast means that the low pressure area causing the wind is stronger than forecast.\nWind shear is important, too. Defined as F change in direc,ion and/or velocity over distance or height, wind shear can result in enthusiastic turbu.ence and can create low-altitude hazards aro5nd airports.
